Atlanta would take flight in the first quarter as quarterback Matt Ryan completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Gonzalez, followed by cornerback Tye Hill returning an interception 62 yards for a touchdown.  The Redskins would answer in the second quarter as kicker Shaun Suisham nailed a 48-yard field goal, yet the Falcons kept their attack on as running back Michael Turner got a 30-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker Jason Elam booting a 33-yard field goal. Washington began to rally in the third quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Ladell Betts.  The Redskins would come closer in the fourth quarter as quarterback Jason Campbell hooked up with tight end Todd Yoder on a 3-yard touchdown pass, yet Atlanta closed out the game with Turner's 58-yard touchdown run.",

In the first quarter, New York scored first as QB Eli Manning completed a 40-yard TD pass to WR Amani Toomer, along with kicker John Carney getting a 31-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead as Carney got a 38-yard field goal.  The Redskins would close out the half with WR Devin Thomas getting a 29-yard TD run. In the third quarter, New York began to pull away as RB Brandon Jacobs got a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants sealed the deal with Carney connecting on a 39-yard field goal. With the season-sweep, the Giants improved to 11-1, exceeding the 1986 and 1990 teams (both started 10-2 and eventually won the Super Bowl) for the best 12-game record in franchise history.",

        "passage": " Trying to rebound from their home loss to the Texans, the Panther flew to the Georgia Dome for an NFC South duel with the Atlanta Falcons. After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina scored first in the second quarter with kicker John Kasay hitting a 45-yard field goal. The Falcons took the lead with QB Joey Harrington completing a 69-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. The Panthers followed up with QB Jake Delhomme completing a 13-yard TD pass to RB DeShaun Foster. Atlanta would end the half with kicker Morten Andersen hitting a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Falcons took the lead as Harrington completed a 13-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler. Carolina retook the lead with Delhomme completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King, followed by a 10-yard TD run from Foster. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers scored again, with Kasay kicking a 49-yard field goal. The Falcons' Andersen nailed a 25-yard field goal to end the scoring. The game was noteworthy because of DeAngelo Hall's third quarter meltdown, wherein he was assessed 67 yards of penalties in a single drive. The penalties included a 37-yard pass interference penalty for tackling WR Steve Smith before the ball arrived, a 15-yard personal foul on the following play for blocking Smith at the line, and a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty during a verbal exchange with Smith following a third-down sack by John Abraham. The unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave Carolina a first down, allowing their eventual TD to King rather than the likely 45-yard field goal attempt had the penalty not been called. Following the series, Hall was seen arguing with coaches on the sidelines, leading to a $100,000 fine by the team.",

After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina scored first in the second quarter with kicker John Kasay hitting a 45-yard field goal. The Falcons took the lead with QB Joey Harrington completing a 69-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. The Panthers followed up with QB Jake Delhomme completing a 13-yard TD pass to RB DeShaun Foster. Atlanta would end the half with kicker Morten Andersen hitting a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Falcons took the lead as Harrington completed a 13-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler. Carolina retook the lead with Delhomme completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King, followed by a 10-yard TD run from Foster. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers scored again, with Kasay kicking a 49-yard field goal. The Falcons' Andersen nailed a 25-yard field goal to end the scoring. The game was noteworthy because of DeAngelo Hall's third quarter meltdown, wherein he was assessed 67 yards of penalties in a single drive. The penalties included a 37-yard pass interference penalty for tackling WR Steve Smith before the ball arrived, a 15-yard personal foul on the following play for blocking Smith at the line, and a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty during a verbal exchange with Smith following a third-down sack by John Abraham. The unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave Carolina a first down, allowing their eventual TD to King rather than the likely 45-yard field goal attempt had the penalty not been called. Following the series, Hall was seen arguing with coaches on the sidelines, leading to a $100,000 fine by the team.",

In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee managed to get a 48-yard field goal, along with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 23-yard field goal.  However, Jacksonville responded with QB David Garrard completing a 36-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Williams. In the third quarter, San Diego responded with RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 6-yard TD run, yet the Jaguars answered with Garrard completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Marcedes Lewis.  In the fourth quarter, the Chargers tried to make a comeback as QB Philip Rivers completed a 24-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates.  But it was too-little too-late, as Jacksonville's defense held on to win.",

The Texans trailed early after QB Kerry Collins threw a 3 and a 1-yard TD pass to WR Nate Washington and to WR Justin Gage. This was followed by RB Chris Johnson getting an 11-yard TD run. The Texans got on the scoreboard after kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard field goal, but fell further behind after kkicker Rob Bironas hit a 30-yard field goal. The Texans tried to cut the lead with QB Matt Schaub getting a 12-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, but the Titans would pull away with RB Javon Ringer getting a 7-yard TD run. The Texans tried to come back into the game, but only came away with Schaub throwing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter. With the loss, the Texans fell to 5-9, and were officially eliminated from postseason contention.",

The Bengals however took the lead later on in the quarter when Andy Dalton found Brandon LaFell on a 14-yard pass to make it 7-6.  The Bears retook the lead in the second quarter when Mike Nugent kicked 2 field goals:  From 34 and 27 yards out to make it 9-7 and then 12-7 at halftime.  The Bears then shut out the Bengals the entire second half while they score themselves:  In the third quarter Mitchell Trubisky ran for a 4-yard touchdown to make it 19-7 for the only score of the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter, they wrapped up the scoring when Trubisky found Adam Shaheen on a 1-yard pass to make it 26-7.  Howard then ran for an 8-yard touchdown to make the final score 33-7. With the loss, the Bengals dropped to 5-8.  The team is also assured their second straight non-winning season.",

In the first quarter, the 'Hawks RB Julius Jones got a 27-yard TD run, along with DT Craig Terrill returning a fumble 10 yards for a touchdown.  The 49ers would reply with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 26-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Nedney gave San Francisco a 28-yard field goal.  Seattle responded with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 51-yard field goal.  The 49ers would hack away at the lead as QB J. T. O'Sullivan completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Bryant Johnson, yet the Seahawks closed out the half with Mare's 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, San Francisco took the lead with LB Patrick Willis returning an interception 86 yards for a touchdown, along with RB Frank Gore's 2-yard TD run.  Seattle regained the lead as RB T. J. Duckett made a 1-yard TD run, along with Mare kicking a 32-yard field goal.  However, the 49ers tied the game with Nedney's 28-yard field goal.  In overtime, San Francisco's Nedney nailed the game-winning 40-yard field goal. Julius Jones (26 carries for 127 yards and a touchdown) got his first 100-yard game since Week 14 of 2006.",

In the first quarter, the Texans delivered the first punch with WR Jerome Mathis returning a kickoff 84 yards for a touchdown.  However, the Colts responded with QB Peyton Manning completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark.  In the second quarter, Houston retook the lead with kicker Kris Brown getting a 33-yard field goal.  However, Indianapolis went ahead with RB Joseph Addais 4-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Colts managed to put the Texans in a huge hole with kicker Adam Vinatieri's 36-yard field goal, Addai's 8-yard TD run, and Vinatieri's 28-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Houston tried a comeback with RB Samkon Gado's 1-yard TD run.  Indianapolis would get their final score of the game with Vinatieri kicking a 35-yard field goal.  The Texans drew close with QB Matt Schaub's 1-yard TD pass to RB Vonta Leach.  However, the Colts managed to hold on to win.",

In the second quarter the Titans trailed with kicker David Akers making a 25-yard field goal. But they put themselves ahead with QB Kerry Collins completing a 26-yard TD pass to WR Kenny Britt. The Eagles replied with QB Kevin Kolb making a 5-yard TD pass to WR Riley Cooper, followed by kicker David Akers hitting a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Titans fell further behind with Akers making a 46-yard field goal. They soon replied with kicker Rob Bironas nailing a 41-yard field goal, but the Eagles continued to score in the 4th with Akers getting a 28-yard field goal. Eventually, they rallied to take a big lead with Collins completing an 80-yard TD pass to Britt, followed by Bironas hitting a 38-yard field goal. Then Collins found Britt for the third time in the game on a 16-yard TD pass, and then Bironas made a 33-yard field goal. The Titans continued to get their momentum going with CB Cortland Finnegan returning an interception 41&#160;yards for a touchdown.",

After a scoreless first quarter, the Lions' Mikel Leshoure ran in three consecutive touchdowns, from 7, 1, and 8 yards out respectively to take a 21-point lead going into halftime. Leshoure became the first Lions rusher to score three touchdowns in the first half. After a scoreless third quarter, Detroit's Jason Hanson kicked a 42-yard field goal. The Jaguars finally got on the board when Micheal Spurlock caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Blaine Gabbert; they then completed a two-point conversion when Blaine Gabbert completed a pass to Rashad Jennings. The Lions responded with a 10-yard touchdown run from Joique Bell. Jacksonville scored the final points of the game with a 6-yard touchdown catch from Blaine Gabbert to Justin Blackmon; they again went for a two-point conversion, but were unsuccessful this time. It was the Lions' most lopsided win of the season and would also be their final victory of the 2012 season.",

        "passage": " Still looking for their first win of the year, the Dolphins flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for a Week 6 intraconference duel with the Cleveland Browns.  With QB Trent Green still suffering from a concussion from last week, back-up QB Cleo Lemon was given the start. In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Browns RB Jason Wright got a 1-yard TD run.  The 'Fins would respond with kicker Jay Feely getting a 43-yard field goal.  However, Cleveland increased its lead with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Browns kicker Phil Dawson getting a 40-yard field goal, along with Anderson completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  The Dolphins answered with Lemon completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE David Martin, yet Cleveland managed to get a 20-yard field goal from Dawson as time ran out. In the third quarter, the 'Fins started to retaliate with Lemon getting a 5-yard and a 1-yard TD run.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Browns would pull away with Anderson and Edwards hooking up with each other on a 5-yard and a 16-yard TD pass.  Miami's only response would be Lemon's 4-yard TD pass to Martin. With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0-6 for the first time since 2004, but they also suffered their 9th-straight loss (the worst losing streak in franchise history). Along with the St. Louis Rams, it marked the first time since 2000 (Bengals and Chargers) that two teams began a season at 0-6.",

In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Browns RB Jason Wright got a 1-yard TD run. The 'Fins would respond with kicker Jay Feely getting a 43-yard field goal. However, Cleveland increased its lead with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Browns kicker Phil Dawson getting a 40-yard field goal, along with Anderson completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards. The Dolphins answered with Lemon completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE David Martin, yet Cleveland managed to get a 20-yard field goal from Dawson as time ran out. In the third quarter, the 'Fins started to retaliate with Lemon getting a 5-yard and a 1-yard TD run. Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Browns would pull away with Anderson and Edwards hooking up with each other on a 5-yard and a 16-yard TD pass. Miami's only response would be Lemon's 4-yard TD pass to Martin. With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0-6 for the first time since 2004, but they also suffered their 9th-straight loss (the worst losing streak in franchise history). Along with the St. Louis Rams, it marked the first time since 2000 (Bengals and Chargers) that two teams began a season at 0-6.",

Unfortunately , in the fourth quarter , the Browns would pull away with Anderson and Edwards hooking up with each other on a 5 - yard and a 16 - yard TD pass . Miami 's only response would be Lemon 's 4 - yard TD pass to Martin . With the loss , not only did the Dolphins fall to 0 - 6 for the first time since 2004 , but they also suffered their 9th - straight loss ( the worst losing streak in franchise history ) . Along with the St. Louis Rams , it marked the first time since 2000 ( Bengals and Chargers ) that two teams began a season at 0 - 6 .",

They scored first late in the first quarter with a 38-yard field goal by Billy Cundiff. They added to their lead with a 62-yard catch and run TD by Derrick Mason from Joe Flacco. The Lions scored their only points of the game near the end of the second quarter with a 22-yard Jason Hanson field goal. A minute later the Ravens responded with a 59-yard rushing TD by Ray Rice. Baltimore finished out the first half with a 25-yard field goal. In the second half the Ravens scored 4 consecutive touchdowns. First a Le'Ron McClain 3-yard run. Then 2 by Willis McGahee: first an 8-yard run, then a 19-yard run. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens capped off their huge victory when Troy Smith ran in a TD from 15 yards. Lions backup quarterback Daunte Culpepper completed less than half of his passes (16 for 34) and threw 2 interceptions.",

In the first quarter, Tennessee drew first blood as QB Vince Young completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Roydell Williams for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Chiefs tied the game with QB Brodie Croyle completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Samie Parker. Afterwards, the Titans responded with kicker Rob Bironas managing to get a 37-yard field goal. Kansas City would take the lead prior to halftime with Croyle completing a 9-yard TD pass to FB Kris Wilson. In the third quarter, Tennessee would draw close as Bironas kicked a 37-yard field goal. The Chiefs answered with kicker John Carney getting a 36-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Titans would retake the lead with Young and Williams hooking up with each other again on a 41-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, Tennessee clinched the victory with Bironas nailing a 40-yard and a 25-yard field goal. With the win, the Titans kept their playoff hopes alive at 8-6.",
