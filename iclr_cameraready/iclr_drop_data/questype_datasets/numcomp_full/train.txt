Many of the migrants from China in the 19th century came to work on the pepper and Uncaria gambir plantations , with 11,000 Chinese immigrants recorded in one year . Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements , many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended . By 1860 , the total population had reached around 90,000 , of these 50,000 were Chinese , and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians . The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871 , and the people were grouped into 33 racial , ethnic or national categories , with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6 % . Censuses were then conducted at 10 year intervals afterwards . The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories , and further subdivided into 47 sub - categories . The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans , Eurasians , Malays , Chinese , Indians and Others in 1921 . The Malays group includes other natives of the Malay archipelago , the Europeans include Americans , the Indians would be people from the Indian subcontinent including what would now be Pakistan and Bangladesh . In 1901 , the total population of Singapore was 228,555 , with 15.8 % Malays , 71.8 % Chinese , 7.8 % Indians , and 3.5 % Europeans and Eurasians . The Chinese population figure of Singapore has stayed at over 70 % of the total since , reaching 77.8 % in 1947 . After dropping from a peak of 60 % in the early years of Singapore , the Malay population would range between 11 and 16 % in the first half of the 20th century , while Indians hovered between 7 and just over 9 % in the same period .

Which group of immigrants was in greater numbers in Tripoli in 2009 , [[ Moroccans ]] or [[ Tunisians ]] ? -- MORE
If consular records prior to the revolution are used to estimate the immigrant population , as many as 2 million Egyptian migrants were recorded by the Egyptian embassy in Tripoli in 2009 , followed by 87,200 Tunisians , and 68,200 Moroccans by their respective embassies . The number of Asian migrants before the revolution were roughly 100,000 ( 60,000 Bangladeshis , 18,000 Indians , 10,000 Pakistanis , 8000 Filipinos as well as Chinese , Korean , Vietnamese , Thai and other workers ) . This would put the immigrant population at almost 40 % before the revolution and is a figure more consistent with government estimates in 2004 which put the regular and irregular migrant numbers at 1.35 to 1.8 million ( 25 – 33 % of the population at the time ) .

Which were there more of , [[ convictions ]] or [[ acquittals ]] ? -- MORE
According to the Moscow Armistice , signed by Finland and the victorious Allies , mainly the Soviet Union , the Finns were to try those who were responsible for the war and those who had committed war crimes . The Soviet Union allowed Finland to try its own war criminals , unlike other losing countries of the Second World War . The Finnish parliament had to create ex post facto laws for the trials , though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention . In victorious Allied countries war - crime trials were exceptional , but Finland had to arrange full - scale investigations and trials , and report them for the Soviet Union . Criminal charges were filed against 1,381 Finnish POW camp staff members , resulting in 723 convictions and 658 acquittals . They were accused of 42 murders and 342 other homicides . Nine persons were sentenced to life sentences , 17 to imprisonment for 10 - 15 years , 57 to imprisonment for five to ten years , and 447 to imprisonment varying from one month to five years . Fines or disciplinary corrections were levied out in 124 cases . Although the criminal charges were highly politicized , some war crime charges were filed already during the Continuation War . However , most of them were not processed during wartime .

Which group was the smallest Fegeleins final report , [[ missing ]] or [[ dead ]] ? -- LESS
Fegelein split the territory to be covered into two sections divided by the Pripyat River , with the 1st Regiment taking the northern half and the 2nd Regiment the south . The regiments worked their way from east to west through their assigned territory , and filed daily reports on the number of people killed and taken prisoner . By 1 August , SS Cavalry Regiment 1 under the command of Gustav Lombard was responsible for the death of 800 people ; by 6 August , this total had reached 3,000 " Jews and partisans " . Throughout the following weeks , personnel of SS Cavalry Regiment 1 under Lombards command murdered an estimated 11,000 Jews and more than 400 dispersed soldiers of the Red Army . Thus Fegeleins units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities . Fegeleins final operational report dated 18 September 1941 , states that they killed 14,178 Jews , 1,001 partisans , 699 Red Army soldiers , with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead , 36 wounded , and 3 missing . Historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700 .

Which were there more of in da Câmara 's force , [[ irregulars ]] or [[ officers ]] ? -- MORE
The governor 's campaign continued into May , when a second round of reinforcements arrived . The rebellion was extended to the Oecussi enclave , but without any coordination with the rebellion elsewhere . During the second phase of his offensive , da Câmara divided his reinforced army into four columns . His own column set out from Maubisse and comprised twenty Europeans , two hundred Africans and five hundred moradores . Including the arraias of allied chieftains , it contained over 4,000 troops . It also had a modern Krupp 75 mm field gun . The second column , comprising an Indian company with a Nordenfelt mitrailleuse and several hundred moradores , marched from Soibada ; the third , with two Europeans , seventy Africans and two hundred moradores armed with another Nordenfelt , from Suru ; and the fourth , a flying column with one hundred moradores , from the Dutch border . By the time of the final assault , da Câmara 's force , the largest foreign army ever assembled at the time in Timor , contained 8,000 irregulars , 647second - line troops , 500 first - line troops and 34 officers . Something of the weakness of the native opposition can be gleaned from the record of what weaponry the Portuguese captured : 36 rifles and 590 flintlocks with a few cartridges , plus 495 swords . In general , the native Timorese possessed more spears than guns and were usually short of powder . They avoided close combat , where they were the discrepancy in guns was acutely felt , in favour of hit - and - run guerrilla tactics .

Religious freedom is constitutionally provided for in Ireland . Christianity is the predominant religion , and while Ireland remains a predominantly Catholic country , the percentage of the population who identified as Catholic on the census has fallen sharply from 84.2 percent in the 2011 census to 78.3 percent in the most recent 2016 census . Other results from the 2016 census are : 4.2 % Protestant , 1.3 % as Muslim , and 9.8 % as having no religion . According to a Georgetown University study , before 2000 the country had one of the highest rates of regular Mass attendance in the Western world . While daily attendance was 13 % in 2006 , there was a reduction in weekly attendance from 81 % in 1990 to 48 % in 2006 , although the decline was reported as stabilising . In 2011 , it was reported that weekly Mass attendance in Dublin was just 18 % , with it being even lower among younger generations .

Which were there more of , [[ white men ]] or [[ Native American allies ]] ? -- MORE
The English offered Chief Blount control of the entire Tuscarora tribe if he assisted the settlers in defeating Chief Hancock . Chief Blount captured Chief Hancock , and the settlers executed him in 1712 . In 1713 the Southern Tuscarora lost their Fort Neoheroka , located in Greene County . About 950 people were killed or captured and sold into slavery in the Caribbean or New England by Colonel Moore and his South Carolina troops . His forces were made up of 33 white men and more than 900 Native American allies , mostly Yamasee and Cherokee , historic competitors to the Tuscarora . At this point , the majority of the surviving Southern Tuscarora began migrating to New York to escape the settlers in North Carolina . Their leader declared that those remaining in the South after 1722 were no longer members of the tribe . They joined the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy , and were accepted as the sixth nation . The remaining Tuscarora signed a treaty with the settlers in June 1718 . It granted them a tract of land on the Roanoke River in what is now Bertie County . This was the area already occupied by Tom Blount , and was specified as 56,000 acres ; Tom Blount was recognized by the Legislature of North Carolina as King Tom Blount . The remaining Southern Tuscarora were removed from their homes on the Pamlico River and forced to Bertie . In 1722 the colony chartered Bertie County . Over the next several decades , the remaining Tuscarora lands continually diminished as the tribe sold off land in deals which speculators designed to take advantage of them .

Conquered by Afonso de Albuquerque in 1510 , Goa stood on an island surrounded by crocodile infested rivers that could , however , be waded across in some areas during the dry season . The closest and most important fording point to the city of Goa was the Passo Seco , defended by the fortress of Benastarim . As no more than 650 soldiers were left to defend Goa , every able - bodied man from among the casados and 1500 Christian lascarins were mobilized . 1000 slaves were armed and divided into four squadrons ; even further , 300 clergymen and 200 retired soldiers volunteered to participate in the defence of the city . Dom Luís de Ataíde decided to distribute his forces in 19 critical points along the eastern river banks , where artillery batteries were established , garrisoned with 20 to 80 men and a contingent of lascarins , to keep the colossal army of Bijapur from crossing . Every battery was to have visual contact with the next and their garrisons were not to leave their posts unless ordered to . The deeper waters of the Mandovi and Zuari rivers , to the north and south respectively , were patrolled by four galleys , a half - galley and twenty small galleys called foists . On the opposite shore northwest of Goa , the Portuguese fortress of Reis Magos was supported by an anchored galleon . As the Viceroy had information that the Turks might join the " league " , he armed a further 125 crafts of many different sizes to secure the control of the waters around Goa , although by then there were n't enough men to crew all the ships and defend the city simultaneously .

About 2,600 - 2,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans in exchange for roughly 2,200 Finnic prisoners of war held by the Germans . In November 2003 , the Simon Wiesenthal Center submitted an official request to Finnish President Tarja Halonen for a full - scale investigation by the Finnish authorities of the prisoner exchange . In the subsequent study by Professor Heikki Ylikangas it turned out that about 2,000 of the exchanged prisoners joined the Russian Liberation Army . The rest , mostly army and political officers , , most likely perished in Nazi concentration camps .

The persecutions did not end , however . In violation of the promise made by Beria to the arrested opposition leaders , mass arrests and executions continued . The political guidance of the anti - revolt operations was effected by the GPU chief in Georgia , Solomon Mogilevsky , and the repressions were largely supported by the Transcaucasian Central Committee . Stalin himself is quoted to have vowed that " all of Georgia must be plowed under " . In a series of raids , the Red Army and Cheka detachments killed thousands of civilians , exterminating entire families including women and children . Mass executions took place in prisons , where people were killed without trial , including even those in prison at the time of the rebellion . Hundreds of arrested were shot directly in railway trunks , so that the dead bodies could be removed faster — a new and effective technical invention by the Cheka officer , Talakhadze . The exact number of casualties and the victims of the purges remains unknown . Approximately 3,000 died in fighting . The number of those who were executed during the uprising or in its immediate aftermath amounted to 7,000 - 10,000 or even more . According to the most recent accounts included also in The Black Book of Communism , 12,578 people were put to death from 29 August to 5 September 1924 . About 20,000 people were deported to Siberia and Central Asian deserts .

Because Bern and Zürich had been preparing the war for a long time , they seized the offensive . Bern opened the first war phase on 26 April , when its first troops crossed the river Aar at Stilli , to support Zürich with the occupation of Thurgau and the assault on the abbatial lands . In mid - May , about 3000 Zürichers , 2000 Bernese , 2000 Toggenburgers and 1800 Protestant Thurgauers marched into the Princely Lands and first hit upon the abbatial city of Wil , that fell on 22 May after a short siege . The allies then pushed forward to St. Gallen and occupied the Abbey of Saint Gall and the Vogtei Rheintal . The abbot fled to Neuravensburg , a lordship north of Lake Constance that the abbey had acquired in 1699 . The five Catholic cantons did occupy Rapperswil , but initially left the abbot without any support . In concordance with contemporaneous laws of war , the abbey and its goods were put an under a military governance and the chattel and riches were abducted to Bern and Zürich .

According to the Yuan dynasty chronicle and Marco Polo 's accounts , a Burmese army " invaded " the Mongol territory of Gold Teeth , and was defeated by the Mongol army in April 1277 . The battle took place either at the Vochang valley or 110 km southwest at Kanngai , which the Burmese called Ngasaunggyan . The Yuan Chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a Burmese army of 40,000 to 50,000 with 10,000 horses and 800 elephants . It also reports only one Mongol was killed , in trying to catch an elephant . According to Marco Polo , the Mongol army consisted of 12,000 mounted archers , and the Burmese army numbered 60,000 men with 2000 elephants , " on each of which was set a tower of timber , well - framed and strong , and carrying from 12 to 16 well - armed fighting men . " Even then , the 40,000 to 60,000 figures of the Burmese army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high ; the Mongols may have erred " on the side of generosity " not to " diminish their glory in defeating superior numbers . " According to Marco Polo 's account , in the early stages of the battle , the Turkish and Mongol horsemen " took such fright at the sight of the elephants that they would not be got to face the foe , but always swerved and turned back , " while the Burmese forces pressed on . But the Mongol commander Huthukh did not panic ; he ordered his troops to dismount , and from the cover of the nearby treeline , aim their bows directly at the advancing elephants . The Mongol archers ' arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled .

According to the Yuanshi , the Yuan fleet set out with an estimated 15,000 Mongol and Chinese soldiers and 1,600 - 8,000 Korean soldiers in 300 large vessels and 400 - 500 smaller craft along with several thousand sailors , although figures vary considerably depending on the source and many modern historians consider the numbers exaggerated . The primary port for the operation was Quanzhou in Fujian , then the center of China 's maritime trade . They landed on Komodahama beach on Tsushima Island on October 5 , 1274 . Sō Sukekuni , governor of Tsushima , led a cavalry unit of 80 to defend the island , but he and his outnumbered unit were killed in the engagement . The Mongols and Koreans subsequently invaded Iki . Tairano Takakage , the Governor of Iki , fought the invaders with about 100 of his cavalrymen , but he killed himself after his unit was defeated . The Mongol forces landed on November 19 in Hakata Bay , a short distance from Dazaifu , the ancient administrative capital of Kyūshū. The following day brought the Battle of Bun'ei , also known as the " First Battle of Hakata Bay " . The Japanese coalition force opposing them included 120 armed samurai each with a warband and likely numbered between 3,000 and 6,000 strong . Later accounts have both sides believing themselves to be drastically outnumbered by the enemy ; the Yuanshi provides an estimate of 102,000 for the Japanese force , while the Japanese Hachiman Gudokun describes the invaders as outnumbering the Japanese 10 to 1 . Conlan argues that the Yuanshi 's account of the battle suggests that both the Japanese and Yuan forces were of similar size . Conlan estimated that both armies numbered around 3,000 each .

In 1620 , he crushed the Commonwealth army at the Battle of Ţuţora . The campaign was suspended for the winter but , in 1621 , both sides resumed hostilities . In 1621 , an army of 100,000 - 250,000 soldiers , led by Osman II , advanced from Constantinople and Edirne in April , towards the Polish frontier . The Polish army had 8,280 hussars , 8,200 cossack style cavalry , 1,400 Lisowski cavalry , 2,160 western cavalry , 6,800 Polish infantry , 5,800 western infantry , 800 Hungarian infantry and 25,000 Zaporozhian Cossacks . The Turks , following their victory in the Battle of Ţuţora , had high hopes of conquering Ukraine , and perhaps even toppling the Commonwealth entirely and reaching the Baltic Sea . This time , however , they were stopped by a Commonwealth army , aided by a large Cossack detachment , at the Battle of Khotyn . The 65,000 Poles and Cossacks were able to withstand an Ottoman army three times the size throughout the month of September . When the Polish cavalry rallied forth in October they broke the will of the besiegers and the Sultan sued for peace . The ensuing peace treaty resulted in no border change but the Commonwealth agreed to stop its interference in Moldavia . Both sides claimed victory , as the Commonwealth saw the battle of Khotyn as a successful stopping of the Ottoman invasion of its mainland and the Ottoman Empire achieved its goal of removing the impending threat on the Moldavian lands . The Polish - Ottoman border would remain relatively peaceful until the Polish - Ottoman War and the Polish - Ottoman War .

In 1665 , the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb decided to take action on the Arakanese marauders and launched the Mughal conquest of Chittagong . He also wanted to avenge for his brother Shah Shuja who was killed in exile by the Arakanese king . The Mughal viceroy of Bengal first lured the Portuguese mercenaries in the service of King Sanda Thudhamma guarding the Chittagong region to defect by giving them fiefs . Then the Mughal fleet took Sandwip in late 1665 . In January 1666 , a Mughal force of 6500 men and 288 boats took Chittagong after a 36 - hours ' siege . They subsequently took as far south as Ramu . Arakan had lost the Chittagong province which it had held since 1459 . Arakan would not recover from the loss of Chittagong , and went into rapid decline . Central authority collapsed in the late 17th century . Sanda Wizaya briefly revived the kingdom . He went to war with Tripura , and raided Sandwip , Prome and Malun . But after his death , Arakan reverted to chaos where king after king was murdered and central authority barely existed . It was easily overrun by the Konbaung armies in 1784 - 1785 .

Were there more [[ elephants in West Africa ]] or [[ southern Africa ]] ? -- MORE
African elephants were listed as Vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) in 2008 , with no independent assessment of the conservation status of the two forms . In 1979 , Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million elephants , with a possible upper limit of 3.0 million . By 1989 , the population was estimated to be 609,000 ; with 277,000 in Central Africa , 110,000 in East Africa , 204,000 in southern Africa , and 19,000 in West Africa . About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests , fewer than had previously been thought . From 1977 to 1989 , elephant populations declined by 74 % in East Africa . After 1987 , losses in elephant numbers accelerated , and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80 % . African forest elephants had a total loss of 43 % . Population trends in southern Africa were mixed , with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia , Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa . Conversely , studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0 % . Due to the vast areas involved , assessing the total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork . The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012 .

Were there more [[ estimated Christians ]] or [[ Muslims in Van in 1862 ]] ? -- MORE
The demographics of Van are a greatly debated point , given the changing provincial borders . For example , in 1875 the province was divided ; Van and Hakkari were separated , only to be rejoined in 1888 , drastically changing the census numbers . Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority . In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians ( including Syriac Christianity ) and 95,100 Muslims . The French Consul in Van reported that in Van and Bitlis 51.46 % were Kurds , 32.70 % were Armenians and 5.53 % were Turks . On the other hand , the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople estimated 185,000 Armenians in Van , 18,000 Assyrians , 72,000 Kurds , 47,000 Turks , 25,000 Yezidis and 3,000 Gypsies . Both sides have been accused of overcounting the numbers at the time given the revival of the Armenian Question and population statistics became important during the Berlin Conference .

With regulations in place and DDT banned , the eagle population rebounded . The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada , particularly near large bodies of water . In the early 1980s , the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals , with 110,000 – 115,000 by 1992 ; the U.S. state with the largest resident population is Alaska , with about 40,000 – 50,000 , with the next highest population the Provinces and territories of Canada of British Columbia with 20,000 – 30,000 in 1992 . Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult . The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006 , when 9789 breeding pairs were reported . For some time , the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida , where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use . Today , the Contiguous United States with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is Minnesota with an estimated 1,312 pairs , surpassing Floridas most recent count of 1,166 pairs . 23 , or nearly half , of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles .
