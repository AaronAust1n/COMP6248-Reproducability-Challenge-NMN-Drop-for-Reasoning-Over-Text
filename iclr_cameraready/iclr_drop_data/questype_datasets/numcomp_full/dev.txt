In 1905 , 1,003 Korean immigrants , which included 802 men and 231 women and children , departed from the port of Chemulpo , Incheon aboard the ship Ilford to Salina Cruz , Oaxaca , Mexico . The journey took 45 days , after which they took a train to Coatzacoalcos , Veracruz . In the Veracruz port , another boat was taken to the port of Progreso with the final destination being the capital city of Mérida , Yucatan . They arrived in May 1905 , with previously signed contracts for four years ' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán henequen haciendas . Many of these Koreans were distributed throughout the Yucatán in 32 henequen haciendas . The town of Motul , Yucatan , located in the heart of the henequen zone , was a destination for many of the Korean immigrants . Subsequently , in 1909 , at the end of their contracts , they began a new stage in which they scattered even further Thus , the majority of those who came were single men who made or remade their family lives with Yucatecan especially Maya women . While Korean girls were much more subject to marriages arranged by Korean parents , males had greater freedom when it came to making a family . This rapid intermarriage by Koreans , coupled with geographic dispersal , prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants among the Yucatan Peninsula . After that 1905 ship , no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded , until many years later , leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905 . These descendants have started the Museo Conmemorativo de la Inmigración Coreana a Yucatán , a museum for the remembrance of their ancestors journey .

In the first wave attack were there more [[ Portuguese soldiers ]] or [[ Lascarins ]] ? -- MORE
On 26 October 1591 , the Portuguese , led by André Furtado , mounted a military campaign against the Jaffna kingdom from Mannar . The forces consisted of 1,400 Portuguese soldiers and 3,000 Lascarins , who sailed with 43 ships and more than 200 small vessels . Jaffna forces were expecting the arrival in Kayts , but the fleet landed in Colombuthurai . With the support of heavy firepower , the first wave of 150 Portuguese soldiers and 200 Lascarins reached land . The first - wave attack favoured the Portuguese , who managed to kill the enemy soldiers and captured two pieces of artillery , more than 300 muskets , various other weapons , and ammunition . The second wave , comprising 400 Portuguese soldiers , reached land , followed by the rest of the soldiers , who captured a storehouse and stationed at night . The next day , the Portuguese forces marched toward the capital and faced a defensive attack led by Prince Gago , son - in - law of Puvirasa Pandaram . Gago was killed in action and his entire company was wiped out . Advancing forces faced another ferocious defensive attack between the Nallur Kandaswamy temple and the Nallur Weerakaliyamman temple . Prince Ethirimana Cinkam was wounded and was about to be executed by the invading forces , but was saved by a captain , Simão Pinhão . The Portuguese army captured the king when he tried to escape into a temple . André Furtado ordered the king 's execution by beheading . His head was then placed on a pike and kept on display for several days . The palace was sacked and the king 's entire family was taken captive . Eight hundred Badagas and some Moors of Kozhikode were beheaded , as they were considered enemies . All the vessels in the port were burnt except two vessels for the use of the king . Three ships , 100 Portuguese soldiers , and 200 Lascarins were stationed in Jaffna at the request of the new king .

Late in the 18th Century , Qing dynasty set about a momentous task , the creation of the Siku Quanshu . The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the Siku Quanshu in 1772 . Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books . The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital , however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition . Towards the end of 1772 , seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books , the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti - Manchu sentiment . Less than three months after the issue of this decree , four to five thousand books were handed in . By March of 1773 , an editorial board was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them . This board included over 361 scholars , with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong as chief editors . There was around 3,826 scribes who copied every word by hand . These copyists were not paid in coinage but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia . It took over a decade until the encyclopedia was completed and all seven copies were distributed .

On 7 - 8 October at the Battle of Slobodyshche 14,000 - 15,000 Poles and 5,000 - 6,000 Tatars defeated the Cossacks under Yurii Khmelnytsky , who was trying to link up with Sheremetev . After the unsuccessful battle Yurii began talks with the Poles . As a result , he broke the alliance with Moscow and 17 October signed Slobodischensky Tacktat , under which the Hetmanate rejoined the Commonwealth . After learning of this switch , Tsetsyura and his Cossacks , who were with Sheremetev , also changed sides . This left Sheremetev , who was defending Chudnov in a dangerous position . At the Battle of Chudnov the Poles defeated the Russians . The fortified Russo - Cossack camp was completely encircled . During the battle Tsetsyura went over to the royal army with 2,000 Cossacks . However , most of the Left - Bank Cossack regiments remained the loyal to Moscow . . ) The 15,000 - man Russian army was completely surrounded . Prince Yuri Baryatinsky left Kiev to help Sheremetev , but was stopped at Brusilov by Polish cavalry under Jan Sobieski . The Russians made unsuccessful forays from the besieged camp , but could not change anything . On 4 November Sheremetev was forced to capitulate . The disarmed Russian soldiers were released . The price was high : the Russians had to pay 300,000 rubles and evacuate Kiev , Pereyaslav , Chernigov . Sheremetev remained in captivity . On the night of 4 - 5 November , as soon as the 10,000 Russians gave up their weapons , the Tatars broke into the camp and started grabbing people with lassos . The disarmed Russians defended themselves as well as they could , but the Tatars killed many with arrows and took about 8,000 prisoners . Yielding to a demand , the Poles gave Sheremetev to the Tatars . The Russians and Left - Bank Cossacks lost 4,200 killed , 4,000 wounded and 20,500 captives .

More than 5,000 US troops of General John J. Pershing 's forces , including elements of the 7th Cavalry and the African - American U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment , entered Mexico in hot pursuit of Villa . The campaign consisted primarily of dozens of minor skirmishes with small bands of insurgents . Gen. Pershing failed to catch up to Villa . On 21 June 1916 , two troops of the 10th , totaling 92 troopers , attacked Mexican Federal Army troops in an engagement in the Battle of Carrizal , Chihuahua . 12 US troops were killed and 23 taken prisoner ; 45 Federales were casualties , including the Mexican general Gomez . The engagement nearly precipitated open war with the Mexican government , but both governments immediately moved to lessen tensions and open negotiations for US withdrawal , preventing war . The prisoners were repatriated at El Paso , Texas by the Carrancista government .

Ethiopia was saved from a major defeat and a permanent loss of territory due to a massive airlift of military supplies , the arrival of 16,000 Cuban troops , 1,500 Soviet advisors and 2 brigades from South Yemen , also airlifted to reinforce Harar . The Ethiopians prevailed at Harar , Dire Dawa , Jijiga and began to push the Somalis out of the Ogaden systematically . By March 1978 , the Ethiopians had captured almost all of the Ogaden , prompting the defeated Somalis to give up their claim to the region . With 1/3 of the initial Somali National Army invasion force killed and 1/2 of the Somali Airforce destroyed , the war left Somalia with a disorganized and demoralized army and an angry population . All of these conditions led to a revolt in the army which eventually spiraled into a civil war and Somalia 's current situation .

Which of the 293 comuneros who were excluded from pardon were there more of , [[ those who purchased amnesty ]] or [[ those who were pardoned later ]] ? -- MORE
Charles V returned to Spain on July 16 , 1522 . Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur , but only sporadically . Embarrassingly large numbers of important people had supported the comuneros , or at least were suspiciously slow to declare allegiance to the king , and Charles thought it unwise to press the issue too much . Back in Valladolid , Charles declared a general pardon on November 1 . The pardon gave amnesty to everyone involved in the revolt with the exception of 293 comuneros , a small figure given the huge number of rebels . Both Pacheco and Bishop Acuña were among the 293 excluded from the pardon . More pardons were issued later , after pressure from the Cortes ; by 1527 , the repression was completely at end . Of the 293 , 23 were executed , 20 died in prison , 50 purchased amnesty , and 100 were pardoned later . The fates of the rest are unknown .

Which were there more of , [[ flying boats ]] or [[ educated pilots ]] ? -- MORE
Since 1912 the Royal Danish Navy has operated aircraft either as a functional part of the navy or as flights conducted by the Royal Danish Air Force . Aviation pioneer Robert Svendsen purchased the first aircraft , a Henry Farman , and gave it to the navy who subsequently named it Glenten . Later the same year , a private funding effort made it possible to purchase two Donnet - Leveque flying boats named Maagen and Ternen . At the outbreak of World War One the navy had two operational flying boats and five educated pilots making it possible to make daily reconnaissance flights over the Sound , monitoring German mine - laying activities . From 1914 to 1917 , the Orlogsværftet produced eight OV - flying boats and in 1915 and 1916 two naval flying stations were established in Copenhagen and Nyborg , mainly focusing on the two international seaways Øresund and Storebælt . After the war the Danish production of aircraft was stopped due to several crashes and an international surplus of warplanes . Following British advice , five Avro 504 were purchased for training purposes and based in Ringsted between the two important straits .
