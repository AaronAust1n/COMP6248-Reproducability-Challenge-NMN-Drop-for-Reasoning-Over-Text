Atlanta would take flight in the first quarter as quarterback Matt Ryan completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Gonzalez, followed by cornerback Tye Hill returning an interception 62 yards for a touchdown.  The Redskins would answer in the second quarter as kicker Shaun Suisham nailed a 48-yard field goal, yet the Falcons kept their attack on as running back Michael Turner got a 30-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker Jason Elam booting a 33-yard field goal. Washington began to rally in the third quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Ladell Betts.  The Redskins would come closer in the fourth quarter as quarterback Jason Campbell hooked up with tight end Todd Yoder on a 3-yard touchdown pass, yet Atlanta closed out the game with Turner's 58-yard touchdown run.",

In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee managed to get a 48-yard field goal, along with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 23-yard field goal.  However, Jacksonville responded with QB David Garrard completing a 36-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Williams. In the third quarter, San Diego responded with RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 6-yard TD run, yet the Jaguars answered with Garrard completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Marcedes Lewis.  In the fourth quarter, the Chargers tried to make a comeback as QB Philip Rivers completed a 24-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates.  But it was too-little too-late, as Jacksonville's defense held on to win.",

'04) for an NFC South match-up on Monday Night.  From the get-go the Falcons trailed, when they had a punt blocked by Saints safety Steve Gleason and DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone for the touchdown.  The Falcons would respond, as kicker Morten Andersen (who used to play for the Saints) kicked a 26-yard field goal.  That would be their only score of the night, as WR Devery Henderson ran for an 11-yard TD on a reverse.  Then, Saints kicker John Carney would provide the remaining points for the New Orleans, as he kicked two field goals in the second quarter (a 37-yarder and a 51-yarder) and one field goal in the third (a 20-yarder).  The Falcons would fall to 2-1, as their offense got swapped, battered, and bruised.  QB Michael Vick got sacked five times, while he and RB Warrick Dunn would only combine for 101 rushing yards.",

The Texans got on the scoreboard after kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard field goal, but fell further behind after kkicker Rob Bironas hit a 30-yard field goal. The Texans tried to cut the lead with QB Matt Schaub getting a 12-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, but the Titans would pull away with RB Javon Ringer getting a 7-yard TD run. The Texans tried to come back into the game, but only came away with Schaub throwing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter.

        "passage": " The Eagles, who had not won on prime time in two years, faced off against the defending Super Bowl champion   New York Giants on a Sunday night game at Lincoln Financial Field.  Mike Patterson batted up and intercepted Eli Manning, returning the ball inside the New York 10-yard line.  Two plays later DeSean Jackson took the direct snap and rushed 9-yards, diving to the pylon for a touchdown less than two minutes into the game.  Manning then led the Giants up the field and he found Plaxico Burress for a 17-yard touchdown.  The Eagles fumbled the kickoff, and New York cashed in for a field goal.  On New York's next drive, Manning capped off another long drive with a short touchdown pass to Kevin Boss to take a 17-7 lead early in the second quarter.  A fumble by Giant rusher Brandon Jacobs gave Philadelphia the ball in New York territory.  Six plays later, Donovan McNabb completed a 10-yard pass to Jason Avant for an Eagle touchdown.  Sam Madison picked off McNabb deep in Eagle territory on the next drive, but the Giants settled for a field goal to make it 20-14.  McNabb ran the two-minute drill before the half to get the Eagles a 29-yard field goal before halftime, narrowing the score to 20-17.  After a good kickoff return by rookie Quintin Demps, the Eagles navigated the short field for another touchdown, this one a fade to Hank Baskett and a 24-20 Philadelphia lead.  The Giants, continuing to have success with their ground game, drove down the field.  On a critical 3rd-and-10 from the Eagle 20-yard line, Manning completed a 17-yard pass to Boss, but was flagged for crossing the line of scrimmage.  Giants' coach Tom Coughlin challenged the call, and it was reversed, giving New York 1st-and-goal.  They scored when Jacobs powered forward on a 3-yard run.  Another long Giant drive led to a field goal early in the fourth quarter making it 30-24 Giants.  The Giants scored again on their next drive, a 3-yard rush by Jacobs.  Andy Reid challenged consecutive plays at the end of the drive, but lost both of them, leaving the Eagles with only one timeout, 9:30 left to play, and a 36-24 deficit (after New York missed on the two-point conversion).  A 32-yard completion to DeSean Jackson jump-started the offense, and McNabb hit Kevin Curtis for a 2-yard touchdown on fourth down to keep Philadelphia alive.  The Eagles got the ball back with 3:14 left, but could not convert on a 4th-and-1 near midfield to lose the game 36-31.  McNabb had three touchdown passes, but Brian Westbrook was limited to just 26 yards on 13 carries.  Jacobs rushed for 126 yards and two touchdowns for the Giants.  The Eagles fell to 5-4, 0-3 in their division.",

        "cleaned_passage": "The Eagles, who had not won on prime time in two years, faced off against the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants on a Sunday night game at Lincoln Financial Field. Mike Patterson batted up and intercepted Eli Manning, returning the ball inside the New York 10-yard line. Two plays later DeSean Jackson took the direct snap and rushed 9-yards, diving to the pylon for a touchdown less than two minutes into the game. Manning then led the Giants up the field and he found Plaxico Burress for a 17-yard touchdown. The Eagles fumbled the kickoff, and New York cashed in for a field goal. On New York's next drive, Manning capped off another long drive with a short touchdown pass to Kevin Boss to take a 17-7 lead early in the second quarter. A fumble by Giant rusher Brandon Jacobs gave Philadelphia the ball in New York territory. Six plays later, Donovan McNabb completed a 10-yard pass to Jason Avant for an Eagle touchdown. Sam Madison picked off McNabb deep in Eagle territory on the next drive, but the Giants settled for a field goal to make it 20-14. McNabb ran the two-minute drill before the half to get the Eagles a 29-yard field goal before halftime, narrowing the score to 20-17. After a good kickoff return by rookie Quintin Demps, the Eagles navigated the short field for another touchdown, this one a fade to Hank Baskett and a 24-20 Philadelphia lead. The Giants, continuing to have success with their ground game, drove down the field. On a critical 3rd-and-10 from the Eagle 20-yard line, Manning completed a 17-yard pass to Boss, but was flagged for crossing the line of scrimmage. Giants' coach Tom Coughlin challenged the call, and it was reversed, giving New York 1st-and-goal. They scored when Jacobs powered forward on a 3-yard run. Another long Giant drive led to a field goal early in the fourth quarter making it 30-24 Giants. The Giants scored again on their next drive, a 3-yard rush by Jacobs. Andy Reid challenged consecutive plays at the end of the drive, but lost both of them, leaving the Eagles with only one timeout, 9:30 left to play, and a 36-24 deficit (after New York missed on the two-point conversion). A 32-yard completion to DeSean Jackson jump-started the offense, and McNabb hit Kevin Curtis for a 2-yard touchdown on fourth down to keep Philadelphia alive. The Eagles got the ball back with 3:14 left, but could not convert on a 4th-and-1 near midfield to lose the game 36-31. McNabb had three touchdown passes, but Brian Westbrook was limited to just 26 yards on 13 carries. Jacobs rushed for 126 yards and two touchdowns for the Giants. The Eagles fell to 5-4, 0-3 in their division.",

        "passage": " Things got off to a quick start for the Seahawks as rookie Josh Wilson returned the opening kickoff 72 yards to the Bengal 24-yard line. Three plays later, Matt Hasselbeck hit WR Bobby Engram for an 18-yard TD and a 7-0 Seahawks lead. The Bengals were quick to respond, as Bengal QB Carson Palmer hit 6 of his first 7 pass attempts for 90 yards, culminating with an 18-yard touchdown pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh and evening the score at 7-7. After turnovers by each team, Cincinnati K Shayne Graham converted a 43-yard field goal attempt to give the Bengals a 10-7 lead 80 seconds into the second quarter. With 3:06 left in the first half, Seahawk defensive lineman Chartric Darby's   heavy pressure on Palmer led to a Deon Grant interception at the Seattle 31-yard line. A few plays later, Hasselbeck hit Deion Branch with a 42-yard touchdown pass and a 14-10 Seahawk lead at halftime. 3:51 into the third quarter, Cincinnati linebacker Lemar Marshall sacked Hasselbeck in the endzone for a safety, cutting the lead to 14-12. Neither team scored again until there was 9:57 left in the game when Graham booted a 24-yard field goal to give Cincinnati its first lead of the second half at 15-14. On the next possession, Hasselbeck moved the Seahawks to the opposition's 6-yard line. WR Nate Burleson was unable to hold on to a pass in the endzone, and the Seahawks settled for a K Josh Brown field goal, reclaiming the lead at 17-15. Palmer then connected with Chad Johnson on two big pass plays late in the fourth quarter, followed by 2 runs by back-up RB Kenny Watson for a Bengal TD. Cincinnati opted to try a 2-point conversion, but CB Jordan Babineaux stopped Watson after a pitch from Palmer. The Bengals led 21-17 when the Seahawks got the ball with 2:42 left in the game. The Seahawks sputtered near mid-field, and faced 4th and 1. RB Shaun Alexander broke through for 22 yards, and Hasselbeck hit Nate Burleson with a 22-yard TD pass on the next play for a 24-21 lead with 1:00 left. Seahawks linebacker Lance Laury forced a fumble during the ensuing kickoff, with FS Deon Grant recovering for Seattle. Two plays later Alexander ran for a first down (and 100 yards on the game), cementing the Seahawk victory and improving their record to 2-1.",

Three plays later, Matt Hasselbeck hit WR Bobby Engram for an 18-yard TD and a 7-0 Seahawks lead. The Bengals were quick to respond, as Bengal QB Carson Palmer hit 6 of his first 7 pass attempts for 90 yards, culminating with an 18-yard touchdown pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh and evening the score at 7-7. After turnovers by each team, Cincinnati K Shayne Graham converted a 43-yard field goal attempt to give the Bengals a 10-7 lead 80 seconds into the second quarter. With 3:06 left in the first half, Seahawk defensive lineman Chartric Darby's heavy pressure on Palmer led to a Deon Grant interception at the Seattle 31-yard line. A few plays later, Hasselbeck hit Deion Branch with a 42-yard touchdown pass and a 14-10 Seahawk lead at halftime. 3:51 into the third quarter, Cincinnati linebacker Lemar Marshall sacked Hasselbeck in the endzone for a safety, cutting the lead to 14-12. Neither team scored again until there was 9:57 left in the game when Graham booted a 24-yard field goal to give Cincinnati its first lead of the second half at 15-14. On the next possession, Hasselbeck moved the Seahawks to the opposition's 6-yard line. WR Nate Burleson was unable to hold on to a pass in the endzone, and the Seahawks settled for a K Josh Brown field goal, reclaiming the lead at 17-15. Palmer then connected with Chad Johnson on two big pass plays late in the fourth quarter, followed by 2 runs by back-up RB Kenny Watson for a Bengal TD. Cincinnati opted to try a 2-point conversion, but CB Jordan Babineaux stopped Watson after a pitch from Palmer. The Bengals led 21-17 when the Seahawks got the ball with 2:42 left in the game. The Seahawks sputtered near mid-field, and faced 4th and 1. RB Shaun Alexander broke through for 22 yards, and Hasselbeck hit Nate Burleson with a 22-yard TD pass on the next play for a 24-21 lead with 1:00 left. Seahawks linebacker Lance Laury forced a fumble during the ensuing kickoff, with FS Deon Grant recovering for Seattle. Two plays later Alexander ran for a first down (and 100 yards on the game), cementing the Seahawk victory and improving their record to 2-1.",

The Bengals however took the lead later on in the quarter when Andy Dalton found Brandon LaFell on a 14-yard pass to make it 7-6.  The Bears retook the lead in the second quarter when Mike Nugent kicked 2 field goals:  From 34 and 27 yards out to make it 9-7 and then 12-7 at halftime.  The Bears then shut out the Bengals the entire second half while they score themselves:  In the third quarter Mitchell Trubisky ran for a 4-yard touchdown to make it 19-7 for the only score of the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter, they wrapped up the scoring when Trubisky found Adam Shaheen on a 1-yard pass to make it 26-7.  Howard then ran for an 8-yard touchdown to make the final score 33-7. With the loss, the Bengals dropped to 5-8.  The team is also assured their second straight non-winning season.",

In the first quarter, the Bears took an early lead when Jordan Howard ran for a 21-yard touchdown (with a failed PAT) to make it 6-0. The Bengals however took the lead later on in the quarter when Andy Dalton found Brandon LaFell on a 14-yard pass to make it 7-6. The Bears retook the lead in the second quarter when Mike Nugent kicked 2 field goals: From 34 and 27 yards out to make it 9-7 and then 12-7 at halftime. The Bears then shut out the Bengals the entire second half while they score themselves: In the third quarter Mitchell Trubisky ran for a 4-yard touchdown to make it 19-7 for the only score of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, they wrapped up the scoring when Trubisky found Adam Shaheen on a 1-yard pass to make it 26-7. Howard then ran for an 8-yard touchdown to make the final score 33-7. With the loss, the Bengals dropped to 5-8. The team is also assured their second straight non-winning season.",

In the first quarter, the 'Hawks RB Julius Jones got a 27-yard TD run, along with DT Craig Terrill returning a fumble 10 yards for a touchdown.  The 49ers would reply with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 26-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Nedney gave San Francisco a 28-yard field goal.  Seattle responded with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 51-yard field goal.  The 49ers would hack away at the lead as QB J. T. O'Sullivan completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Bryant Johnson, yet the Seahawks closed out the half with Mare's 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, San Francisco took the lead with LB Patrick Willis returning an interception 86 yards for a touchdown, along with RB Frank Gore's 2-yard TD run.  Seattle regained the lead as RB T. J. Duckett made a 1-yard TD run, along with Mare kicking a 32-yard field goal.  However, the 49ers tied the game with Nedney's 28-yard field goal.  In overtime, San Francisco's Nedney nailed the game-winning 40-yard field goal. Julius Jones (26 carries for 127 yards and a touchdown) got his first 100-yard game since Week 14 of 2006.",

In the first quarter the 49ers took the lead as QB Alex Smith got a 1-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. The lead was cut when kicker John Kasay nailed a 47-yard field goal. The 49ers scored with kicker Joe Nedney making a 24-yard field goal. The Panthers tied the game with QB Matt Moore completing an 18-yard TD pass to WR David Gettis. The 49ers fell behind in the third quarter with Kasay booting a 55-yard field goal. They eventually got the lead back in the fourth quarter with Nedney hitting a 38-yard field goal, and with DE Ray McDonald returning an interception 31 yards for a touchdown. However, the Panthers tied the game with Moore finding Gettis again on a 23-yarrd TD pass. Following an interception by 49ers backup quarterback David Carr, Kasay successfully booted a 37-yard field goal to give the 49ers the loss.",

Miami trailed early in the first quarter as Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dustin Keller.  The Dolphins' deficit would increase in the second quarter as Sanchez hooked up with Keller again on a 3-yard touchdown pass.  Miami would respond with quarterback Chad Henne completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Anthony Fasano, followed by kicker Dan Carpenter making a 44-yard field goal. The Dolphins would take the lead in the third quarter as Henne connected with wide receiver Brandon Marshall on an 11-yard touchdown pass, but New York would immediately respond as Sanchez found wide receiver Braylon Edwards on a 67-yard touchdown pass.  Miami would answer with Carpenter's 20-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets would add onto their lead as kicker Nick Folk got a 30-yard field goal.  The Dolphins would chip away as their deficit as Carpenter booted a 50-yard field goal, but New York would pull away as running back LaDainian Tomlinson got a 1-yard touchdown run.  Miami tried to rally, but the Jets' defense held on for the win.",

After a scoreless first quarter, the Lions' Mikel Leshoure ran in three consecutive touchdowns, from 7, 1, and 8 yards out respectively to take a 21-point lead going into halftime. Leshoure became the first Lions rusher to score three touchdowns in the first half. After a scoreless third quarter, Detroit's Jason Hanson kicked a 42-yard field goal. The Jaguars finally got on the board when Micheal Spurlock caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Blaine Gabbert; they then completed a two-point conversion when Blaine Gabbert completed a pass to Rashad Jennings. The Lions responded with a 10-yard touchdown run from Joique Bell. Jacksonville scored the final points of the game with a 6-yard touchdown catch from Blaine Gabbert to Justin Blackmon; they again went for a two-point conversion, but were unsuccessful this time. It was the Lions' most lopsided win of the season and would also be their final victory of the 2012 season.",

While the Chiefs got on the board first with Ryan Succop nailing a 45-yard goal, they fell behind when Rashad Jennings ran from the 28-yard line to the end zone for a touchdown. In the second quarter Ryan Succop made a 21-yard field goal, and then the Jaguars scored when David Garrard completed a 61-yard touchdown pass to Mike Sims-Walker. The only score in the third quarter was when Josh Scobee hit a 27-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter the Chiefs fell further behind when Maurice Jones-Drew got a 10-yard touchdown run. The Chiefs tried to come back with Matt Cassel completing a 54-yard and a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Chambers (Second time round the two-point conversion was made when Matt Cassel passed to Jamaal Charles) but couldn't go any further thanks to the Jaguars' defense resulting in a loss.",

        "passage": " Still looking for their first win of the year, the Dolphins flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for a Week 6 intraconference duel with the Cleveland Browns.  With QB Trent Green still suffering from a concussion from last week, back-up QB Cleo Lemon was given the start. In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Browns RB Jason Wright got a 1-yard TD run.  The 'Fins would respond with kicker Jay Feely getting a 43-yard field goal.  However, Cleveland increased its lead with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Browns kicker Phil Dawson getting a 40-yard field goal, along with Anderson completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  The Dolphins answered with Lemon completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE David Martin, yet Cleveland managed to get a 20-yard field goal from Dawson as time ran out. In the third quarter, the 'Fins started to retaliate with Lemon getting a 5-yard and a 1-yard TD run.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Browns would pull away with Anderson and Edwards hooking up with each other on a 5-yard and a 16-yard TD pass.  Miami's only response would be Lemon's 4-yard TD pass to Martin. With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0-6 for the first time since 2004, but they also suffered their 9th-straight loss (the worst losing streak in franchise history). Along with the St. Louis Rams, it marked the first time since 2000 (Bengals and Chargers) that two teams began a season at 0-6.",

In the first quarter, Tennessee drew first blood as QB Vince Young completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Roydell Williams for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Chiefs tied the game with QB Brodie Croyle completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Samie Parker. Afterwards, the Titans responded with kicker Rob Bironas managing to get a 37-yard field goal. Kansas City would take the lead prior to halftime with Croyle completing a 9-yard TD pass to FB Kris Wilson. In the third quarter, Tennessee would draw close as Bironas kicked a 37-yard field goal. The Chiefs answered with kicker John Carney getting a 36-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Titans would retake the lead with Young and Williams hooking up with each other again on a 41-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, Tennessee clinched the victory with Bironas nailing a 40-yard and a 25-yard field goal. With the win, the Titans kept their playoff hopes alive at 8-6.",

New York trailed in the first quarter as Browns kicker Phil Dawson made a 34-yard field goal. The Jets answered with a 27-yard field goal from kicker Nick Folk, but Cleveland responded with running back Peyton Hillis getting a 12-yard touchdown run. New York tied the game in the second quarter with quarterback Mark Sanchez finding wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery on a 25-yard touchdown pass. The Browns regained the lead with Dawson's 23-yard field goal, yet the Jets took the lead with Sanchez's 1-yard touchdown run. After a scoreless third quarter, New York added onto their lead in the fourth quarter with Folk's 25-yard field goal. However, Cleveland tied the game with quarterback Colt McCoy completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi. In overtime, Sanchez found wide receiver Santonio Holmes on the game-ending 37-yard touchdown pass. The Jets became the first team in league history to win back-to-back overtime games on the road.",
