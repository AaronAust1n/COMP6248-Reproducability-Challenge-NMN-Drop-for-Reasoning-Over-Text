        "passage": " Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.",

After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins. They had never, prior to this day, lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover.",

Early in the fourth , Detroit took the lead again , this time by way of Akers hitting a 28 - yard field goal , giving Detroit a 20 - 17 lead . On Washington 's ensuing possession , it appeared as if Washington took the lead , as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57 - yard score and an apparent 24 - 20 lead . However , upon video replay , it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground , thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete , and Washington could not score again , punting . Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal , as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game . Washington did n't give up , however , and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27 - 20 . However , after not recovering the onside kick , Washington needed to stop Detroit . They did this , and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining . Washington got to midfield , but Griffin 's hail mary pass was off the mark , and Washington lost once again . With the loss . Washington fell to 0 - 3 for the first time since 2001 , and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time , having not beaten them since 2008 when they did n't even manage to win a single game . However , Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935 , when they were still the Boston Redskins . They had never , prior to this day , lost to Detroit in Washington or Landover .",

In the first quarter, the Bears struck first with kicker Robbie Gould nailing a 36-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Lions took the lead with QB Jon Kitna completing a 23-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell.  In the second quarter, Chicago bounced back with QB Rex Grossman completing a 13-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian.  Afterwards, RB Adrian Peterson got a 2-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, Detroit retook the lead with Kitna completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Mike Furrey and a 2-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams.  However, in the fourth quarter, the inconsistency that continues to plague the Lions showed as the Bears won with Gould getting a 36-yard field goal, a 39-yard field goal, and a 44-yard field goal and on a dropped pass by Mike Williams in the endzone on the last play of the game.  With their seventh-straight loss, the Lions fell to 2-13 as they were swept by their division rivals.",

        "passage": " Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year.  They would wear their alternate uniforms as they played against the New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 31-yard field goal, while QB Tom Brady completed a 1-yard TD pass to LB Mike Vrabel.  In the second quarter, the Bengals managed to get on the board with QB Carson Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh.  However, New England would respond with Brady completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. Near the end of the 2nd quarter, the Bengals had a chance to get closer to the Pats, but a miscommunication between Palmer and Chad Johnson resulted in a New England interception. Palmer and Johnson argued on the sidelines and all the way back to the locker room. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as Patriots RB Sammy Morris getting a 7-yard TD run.  The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal.  Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. With their third-straight loss, the Bengals entered their bye week at 1-3.  It also marked Cincinnati's 5th loss to New England in the last 6 meetings. After the game, Marvin Lewis was heard yelling at his players for their 1-3 record. He called a team meeting a few days later and said that \"anyone who doesn't want to play shouldn't show up\".",

        "cleaned_passage": "Trying to stop a two-game skid, the Bengals went home for their second Monday Night game of the year. They would wear their alternate uniforms as they played against the New England Patriots. In the first quarter, Cincinnati trailed early as Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 31-yard field goal, while QB Tom Brady completed a 1-yard TD pass to LB Mike Vrabel. In the second quarter, the Bengals managed to get on the board with QB Carson Palmer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh. However, New England would respond with Brady completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss. Near the end of the 2nd quarter, the Bengals had a chance to get closer to the Pats, but a miscommunication between Palmer and Chad Johnson resulted in a New England interception. Palmer and Johnson argued on the sidelines and all the way back to the locker room. In the third quarter, Cincinnati continued to struggle as Patriots RB Sammy Morris getting a 7-yard TD run. The Bengals' only response would be kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 40-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, New England increased its lead with Gostkowski kicking a 36-yard field goal. Cincinnati's final response was Graham kicking a 48-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Patriots sealed the win with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. With their third-straight loss, the Bengals entered their bye week at 1-3. It also marked Cincinnati's 5th loss to New England in the last 6 meetings. After the game, Marvin Lewis was heard yelling at his players for their 1-3 record. He called a team meeting a few days later and said that \"anyone who doesn't want to play shouldn't show up\".",

After a scoreless first quarter, Atlanta would trail early in the second quarter as Bears quarterback Jay Cutler found wide receiver Johnny Knox on a 23-yard touchdown pass.  Afterwards, the Falcons took the lead as quarterback Matt Ryan completed a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roddy White and a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Gonzalez. After a scoreless third quarter, Chicago would tie the game in the fourth quarter with Cutler hooking up with tight end Greg Olsen on a 2-yard touchdown.  Atlanta would regain the lead as running back Michael Turner got a 5-yard touchdown run.  Afterwards, the defense would fend off a last-second Bears drive to lock up the victory.",

The game was tied 3-3 with 4:32 remaining in the first half. Quarterback Joe Flacco struck quickly, however, completing touchdown passes of 65 yards and 10 yards, to Todd Heap and Derrick Mason respectively, just before half time. Trailing 17-3 with about three minutes left in the game, Josh Freeman completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to Kellen Winslow. The Buccaneers were unable to get the ball back on offense, and fell by a score of 17-10.",

The Seahawks would get on the board with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR D. J. Hackett.  In the second quarter, the Seahawks took the lead with RB Maurice Morris getting a 19-yard TD run.  However, Chicago regained the lead with RB Adrian Peterson getting a 5-yard TD run.  Seattle would tie the game kicker Josh Brown getting a 40-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Seahwaks retook the lead as Hasselbeck completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Bears tried to retaliate as Gould kicked a 47-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Seattle pulled away with Brown kicking a 23-yard and a 46-yard field goal.

In the first quarter, Seattle trailed early as Bears RB Cedric Benson got a 43-yard TD run, along with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 31-yard field goal. The Seahawks would get on the board with QB Matt Hasselbeck completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR D. J. Hackett. In the second quarter, the Seahawks took the lead with RB Maurice Morris getting a 19-yard TD run. However, Chicago regained the lead with RB Adrian Peterson getting a 5-yard TD run. Seattle would tie the game kicker Josh Brown getting a 40-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Seahwaks retook the lead as Hasselbeck completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Nate Burleson for the only score of the period.

In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee managed to get a 48-yard field goal, along with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 23-yard field goal.  However, Jacksonville responded with QB David Garrard completing a 36-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Williams. In the third quarter, San Diego responded with RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 6-yard TD run, yet the Jaguars answered with Garrard completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Marcedes Lewis.  In the fourth quarter, the Chargers tried to make a comeback as QB Philip Rivers completed a 24-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates.  But it was too-little too-late, as Jacksonville's defense held on to win.",

From the get-go the Falcons trailed, when they had a punt blocked by Saints safety Steve Gleason and DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone for the touchdown.  The Falcons would respond, as kicker Morten Andersen (who used to play for the Saints) kicked a 26-yard field goal.  That would be their only score of the night, as WR Devery Henderson ran for an 11-yard TD on a reverse.  Then, Saints kicker John Carney would provide the remaining points for the New Orleans, as he kicked two field goals in the second quarter (a 37-yarder and a 51-yarder) and one field goal in the third (a 20-yarder).  The Falcons would fall to 2-1, as their offense got swapped, battered, and bruised.  QB Michael Vick got sacked five times, while he and RB Warrick Dunn would only combine for 101 rushing yards.",

In the first quarter, Indianapolis struck first with K Adam Vinatieri nailing a 30-yard field goal. The Bengals would respond with K Shayne Graham converting a 27-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Colts began their breakout with QB Peyton Manning completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to WR Marvin Harrison. Harrison would end up catching three touchdown passes in this game. Even though Cincinnati responded with 12-yard touchdown run by RB Rudi Johnson, Indianapolis responded with Manning completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Harrison. In the third quarter, the Bengals converted another field goal, and the Colts continued their power with Manning completing another touchdown pass to Marvin Harrison. Afterwards, Manning would complete another touchdown pass, this one an 18-yarder to WR Reggie Wayne. In the fourth quarter, the Bengals' only response was another field goal. After that last field goal by Shayne Graham, Adam Vinatieri responded with a 44-yard field goal to close out the game. With the win, the Colts improved to 11-3. Colts QB Peyton Manning finished the game 29 of 36 for 282 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions, while Bengals QB Carson Palmer was 14 of 28 for 176 passing yards. Palmer also fumbled the football four times in this game. Colts DE Dwight Freeney forced three fumbles in the game and also had three sacks on Carson Palmer.",

        "passage": " Coming off their home win over the Bengals, the Vikings flew to Bank of America Stadium to face the Carolina Panthers in a Week 15 Sunday Night duel. The Vikings clinched the NFC North about an hour before the game thanks in part to Pittsburgh's 37-36 last-second win over the Packers. With a win, the Vikings would be one game behind New Orleans to clinch homefield advantage. After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina got on the board with quarterback Matt Moore finding fullback Brad Hoover on a 1-yard TD pass. The extra point attempt was blocked, however. The Vikings then took the lead later in the quarter with running back Adrian Peterson's 4-yard TD run. After yet another scoreless quarter, it was all Carolina as Matt Moore completed a 42-yard TD pass to wide receiver Steve Smith, as well as running back Jonathan Stewart running in a 3-yard TD, as well as catching a 2-yard TD pass from Moore. With the loss, the Vikings fell to 11-3. Reports surfaced after the game suggesting that there was tension between Vikings quarterback Brett Favre and head coach Brad Childress. The incident was later resolved.",

The Vikings clinched the NFC North about an hour before the game thanks in part to Pittsburgh's 37-36 last-second win over the Packers. With a win, the Vikings would be one game behind New Orleans to clinch homefield advantage. After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina got on the board with quarterback Matt Moore finding fullback Brad Hoover on a 1-yard TD pass. The extra point attempt was blocked, however. The Vikings then took the lead later in the quarter with running back Adrian Peterson's 4-yard TD run. After yet another scoreless quarter, it was all Carolina as Matt Moore completed a 42-yard TD pass to wide receiver Steve Smith, as well as running back Jonathan Stewart running in a 3-yard TD, as well as catching a 2-yard TD pass from Moore. With the loss, the Vikings fell to 11-3. Reports surfaced after the game suggesting that there was tension between Vikings quarterback Brett Favre and head coach Brad Childress. The incident was later resolved.",

        "passage": " After a convincing win over a struggling Redskins team in Week 7, the Colts faced one of their toughest opponents of the year in the Denver Broncos. The Broncos sat atop the AFC West standings with a 5-1 record thanks in large part to a strong running game and a dominating defense that had only allowed two touchdowns on the season. Both defenses played well in the first quarter, which ended with the Colts leading 3-0. Denver took the lead early in the second quarter on a Jake Plummer one-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis cut the lead to one on their next drive, which ended in a 30-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal, but the Broncos answered with a 15-yard touchdown pass from QB Jake Plummer to WR Javon Walker just before halftime to expand their lead to 14-6. On their first drive of the half Indianapolis came within one point of the lead on a 12-yard touchdown pass from QB Peyton Manning to WR Reggie Wayne. On the Colts' next possession, Wayne and Manning hooked up again for another touchdown, this one a 5-yard TD pass to take the lead 20-14. But the Broncos came back with a one-yard touchdown run by Mike Bell, giving them a one-point lead at the end of the third quarter. After a Vinatieri field goal and another Denver touchdown, the Colts were down by 5 points with a little over half of the fourth quarter remaining. After the Colts received the kickoff, they marched down the field. The drive ended with a 19-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Wayne, the third time they hooked up for a touchdown in the game. The Colts were now up by one point and decided to go for the two-point conversion to go up by a field goal. The conversion was a success as Manning found Reggie Wayne in the end zone again. Jason Elam came through for Denver and made a 49-yard field goal to tie the game at 31. The final drive of the game resulted in an Adam Vinatieri field goal with two seconds left to put Indianapolis up by three. Manning ended the game with three touchdown passes, all of them to Reggie Wayne. Rookie RB Joseph Addai had a career-high 93 yards rushing on only 17 carries. DE Dwight Freeney was credited with half a sack, his first of the season.",

On the Colts' next possession, Wayne and Manning hooked up again for another touchdown, this one a 5-yard TD pass to take the lead 20-14. But the Broncos came back with a one-yard touchdown run by Mike Bell, giving them a one-point lead at the end of the third quarter. After a Vinatieri field goal and another Denver touchdown, the Colts were down by 5 points with a little over half of the fourth quarter remaining. After the Colts received the kickoff, they marched down the field. The drive ended with a 19-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Wayne, the third time they hooked up for a touchdown in the game. The Colts were now up by one point and decided to go for the two-point conversion to go up by a field goal. The conversion was a success as Manning found Reggie Wayne in the end zone again. Jason Elam came through for Denver and made a 49-yard field goal to tie the game at 31. The final drive of the game resulted in an Adam Vinatieri field goal with two seconds left to put Indianapolis up by three. Manning ended the game with three touchdown passes, all of them to Reggie Wayne. Rookie RB Joseph Addai had a career-high 93 yards rushing on only 17 carries. DE Dwight Freeney was credited with half a sack, his first of the season.",
        "tokenized_passage": "After a convincing win over a struggling Redskins team in Week 7 , the Colts faced one of their toughest opponents of the year in the Denver Broncos .

After a scoreless first quarter, Seattle got on the board first with QB Matt Hasselbeck's  29-yard pass to tight end John Carlson.  The Bucs got on the board with Connor Barth's 28-yard field goal to end the first half. In the third quarter, Tampa Bay took the lead after a 45-yard field goal and a 22-yard touchdown pass by QB Josh Freeman to running back Cadillac Williams, set up by a Tanard Jackson interception.  The Buccaneers further extended their lead with a 28-yard pass to running back Derrick Ward, with a successful two-point conversion.  In the fourth quarter, Barth kicked another field goal for 39 yards.  Seattle tried to rally, but Hasselbeck threw an interception (his fourth) in the end zone to cornerback Elbert Mack for a touchback. With the win, the Buccaneers improved to 2-12.  Not only was it their first road win since November 23, 2008, it also marked their first win on the west coast since winning Super Bowl XXXVII in San Diego and their first win in Seattle since 1999.",

Arizona would trail early in the first quarter as Patriots running back LaMont Jordan got a one-yard and a three-yard touchdown run. The Cardinals' east coast struggles continued in the second quarter as quarterback Matt Cassel completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to running back Kevin Faulk and an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker, followed by kicker Stephen Gostkowski's 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Arizona's deficit continued to climb as Cassel completed a 76-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Randy Moss, followed by Gostkowski's 35- and 24-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, New England concluded its domination with Gostkowski's 30-yard field goal. The Cardinals would then get a meaningless touchdown as quarterback Matt Leinart completed a 78-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. Original starting quarterback Kurt Warner (6/18 for 30 yards) was pulled in the third quarter via coach's decision.",

The Texans got on the scoreboard after kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard field goal, but fell further behind after kkicker Rob Bironas hit a 30-yard field goal. The Texans tried to cut the lead with QB Matt Schaub getting a 12-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, but the Titans would pull away with RB Javon Ringer getting a 7-yard TD run. The Texans tried to come back into the game, but only came away with Schaub throwing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter.

        "passage": " Coming off a week 2 loss, the Ravens were determined to bounce back and fight hard. On their second offensive play from scrimmage, Flacco threw a 74-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Torrey Smith. It was the first catch of Smith's career and the longest pass of Flacco's career. Before the first quarter was up, Flacco would throw two more touchdown passes to Smith for 41 and 18 yards respectively, marking the 12th time in NFL history that any receiver caught three touchdown passes in a single quarter, and the first time ever for a rookie. The Ravens would later add 16 more points on three Billy Cundiff field goals and a fumble forced by Ray Lewis and recovered by Haloti Ngata and then run into the end zone (Cundiff also missed two 51-yard field goals). This marked the first touchdown in Ngata's career. Offensively, the Ravens gained 553 yards in the entire game, a franchise record. The only score for the Rams came in the third quarter, when quarterback Sam Bradford threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Gibson.",

Before the first quarter was up, Flacco would throw two more touchdown passes to Smith for 41 and 18 yards respectively, marking the 12th time in NFL history that any receiver caught three touchdown passes in a single quarter, and the first time ever for a rookie. The Ravens would later add 16 more points on three Billy Cundiff field goals and a fumble forced by Ray Lewis and recovered by Haloti Ngata and then run into the end zone (Cundiff also missed two 51-yard field goals). This marked the first touchdown in Ngata's career. Offensively, the Ravens gained 553 yards in the entire game, a franchise record. The only score for the Rams came in the third quarter, when quarterback Sam Bradford threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Gibson.",

        "passage": " The Eagles, who had not won on prime time in two years, faced off against the defending Super Bowl champion   New York Giants on a Sunday night game at Lincoln Financial Field.  Mike Patterson batted up and intercepted Eli Manning, returning the ball inside the New York 10-yard line.  Two plays later DeSean Jackson took the direct snap and rushed 9-yards, diving to the pylon for a touchdown less than two minutes into the game.  Manning then led the Giants up the field and he found Plaxico Burress for a 17-yard touchdown.  The Eagles fumbled the kickoff, and New York cashed in for a field goal.  On New York's next drive, Manning capped off another long drive with a short touchdown pass to Kevin Boss to take a 17-7 lead early in the second quarter.  A fumble by Giant rusher Brandon Jacobs gave Philadelphia the ball in New York territory.  Six plays later, Donovan McNabb completed a 10-yard pass to Jason Avant for an Eagle touchdown.  Sam Madison picked off McNabb deep in Eagle territory on the next drive, but the Giants settled for a field goal to make it 20-14.  McNabb ran the two-minute drill before the half to get the Eagles a 29-yard field goal before halftime, narrowing the score to 20-17.  After a good kickoff return by rookie Quintin Demps, the Eagles navigated the short field for another touchdown, this one a fade to Hank Baskett and a 24-20 Philadelphia lead.  The Giants, continuing to have success with their ground game, drove down the field.  On a critical 3rd-and-10 from the Eagle 20-yard line, Manning completed a 17-yard pass to Boss, but was flagged for crossing the line of scrimmage.  Giants' coach Tom Coughlin challenged the call, and it was reversed, giving New York 1st-and-goal.  They scored when Jacobs powered forward on a 3-yard run.  Another long Giant drive led to a field goal early in the fourth quarter making it 30-24 Giants.  The Giants scored again on their next drive, a 3-yard rush by Jacobs.  Andy Reid challenged consecutive plays at the end of the drive, but lost both of them, leaving the Eagles with only one timeout, 9:30 left to play, and a 36-24 deficit (after New York missed on the two-point conversion).  A 32-yard completion to DeSean Jackson jump-started the offense, and McNabb hit Kevin Curtis for a 2-yard touchdown on fourth down to keep Philadelphia alive.  The Eagles got the ball back with 3:14 left, but could not convert on a 4th-and-1 near midfield to lose the game 36-31.  McNabb had three touchdown passes, but Brian Westbrook was limited to just 26 yards on 13 carries.  Jacobs rushed for 126 yards and two touchdowns for the Giants.  The Eagles fell to 5-4, 0-3 in their division.",

Early in the game, the Eagles offense struggled with two goal-line fumbles being recovered by the Packers.  In the first quarter, Packers kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 23-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Philadelphia would score on QB Donovan McNabb's 6-yard TD run.  However, Green Bay managed to get two more field goals, as Rayner got a 54-yarder and a 46-yarder to end the half.  In the second half, it was all Eagles, as in the third quarter, kicker David Akers got a 40-yard field goal, while McNabb and WR Greg Lewis connected on two touchdown passes of 45 and 30 yards.  In the fourth quarter, the Philly offense wrapped things up as McNabb got a 15-yard TD run, while the defense ended the game on a goal-line stand.  With their victory, the Eagles managed to get their first home win of the season as the team improved to 3-1.",

        "passage": " Things got off to a quick start for the Seahawks as rookie Josh Wilson returned the opening kickoff 72 yards to the Bengal 24-yard line. Three plays later, Matt Hasselbeck hit WR Bobby Engram for an 18-yard TD and a 7-0 Seahawks lead. The Bengals were quick to respond, as Bengal QB Carson Palmer hit 6 of his first 7 pass attempts for 90 yards, culminating with an 18-yard touchdown pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh and evening the score at 7-7. After turnovers by each team, Cincinnati K Shayne Graham converted a 43-yard field goal attempt to give the Bengals a 10-7 lead 80 seconds into the second quarter. With 3:06 left in the first half, Seahawk defensive lineman Chartric Darby's   heavy pressure on Palmer led to a Deon Grant interception at the Seattle 31-yard line. A few plays later, Hasselbeck hit Deion Branch with a 42-yard touchdown pass and a 14-10 Seahawk lead at halftime. 3:51 into the third quarter, Cincinnati linebacker Lemar Marshall sacked Hasselbeck in the endzone for a safety, cutting the lead to 14-12. Neither team scored again until there was 9:57 left in the game when Graham booted a 24-yard field goal to give Cincinnati its first lead of the second half at 15-14. On the next possession, Hasselbeck moved the Seahawks to the opposition's 6-yard line. WR Nate Burleson was unable to hold on to a pass in the endzone, and the Seahawks settled for a K Josh Brown field goal, reclaiming the lead at 17-15. Palmer then connected with Chad Johnson on two big pass plays late in the fourth quarter, followed by 2 runs by back-up RB Kenny Watson for a Bengal TD. Cincinnati opted to try a 2-point conversion, but CB Jordan Babineaux stopped Watson after a pitch from Palmer. The Bengals led 21-17 when the Seahawks got the ball with 2:42 left in the game. The Seahawks sputtered near mid-field, and faced 4th and 1. RB Shaun Alexander broke through for 22 yards, and Hasselbeck hit Nate Burleson with a 22-yard TD pass on the next play for a 24-21 lead with 1:00 left. Seahawks linebacker Lance Laury forced a fumble during the ensuing kickoff, with FS Deon Grant recovering for Seattle. Two plays later Alexander ran for a first down (and 100 yards on the game), cementing the Seahawk victory and improving their record to 2-1.",

Three plays later, Matt Hasselbeck hit WR Bobby Engram for an 18-yard TD and a 7-0 Seahawks lead. The Bengals were quick to respond, as Bengal QB Carson Palmer hit 6 of his first 7 pass attempts for 90 yards, culminating with an 18-yard touchdown pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh and evening the score at 7-7. After turnovers by each team, Cincinnati K Shayne Graham converted a 43-yard field goal attempt to give the Bengals a 10-7 lead 80 seconds into the second quarter. With 3:06 left in the first half, Seahawk defensive lineman Chartric Darby's heavy pressure on Palmer led to a Deon Grant interception at the Seattle 31-yard line. A few plays later, Hasselbeck hit Deion Branch with a 42-yard touchdown pass and a 14-10 Seahawk lead at halftime. 3:51 into the third quarter, Cincinnati linebacker Lemar Marshall sacked Hasselbeck in the endzone for a safety, cutting the lead to 14-12. Neither team scored again until there was 9:57 left in the game when Graham booted a 24-yard field goal to give Cincinnati its first lead of the second half at 15-14. On the next possession, Hasselbeck moved the Seahawks to the opposition's 6-yard line. WR Nate Burleson was unable to hold on to a pass in the endzone, and the Seahawks settled for a K Josh Brown field goal, reclaiming the lead at 17-15. Palmer then connected with Chad Johnson on two big pass plays late in the fourth quarter, followed by 2 runs by back-up RB Kenny Watson for a Bengal TD. Cincinnati opted to try a 2-point conversion, but CB Jordan Babineaux stopped Watson after a pitch from Palmer. The Bengals led 21-17 when the Seahawks got the ball with 2:42 left in the game. The Seahawks sputtered near mid-field, and faced 4th and 1. RB Shaun Alexander broke through for 22 yards, and Hasselbeck hit Nate Burleson with a 22-yard TD pass on the next play for a 24-21 lead with 1:00 left. Seahawks linebacker Lance Laury forced a fumble during the ensuing kickoff, with FS Deon Grant recovering for Seattle. Two plays later Alexander ran for a first down (and 100 yards on the game), cementing the Seahawk victory and improving their record to 2-1.",

In the first quarter, the 'Hawks RB Julius Jones got a 27-yard TD run, along with DT Craig Terrill returning a fumble 10 yards for a touchdown.  The 49ers would reply with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 26-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Nedney gave San Francisco a 28-yard field goal.  Seattle responded with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 51-yard field goal.  The 49ers would hack away at the lead as QB J. T. O'Sullivan completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Bryant Johnson, yet the Seahawks closed out the half with Mare's 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, San Francisco took the lead with LB Patrick Willis returning an interception 86 yards for a touchdown, along with RB Frank Gore's 2-yard TD run.  Seattle regained the lead as RB T. J. Duckett made a 1-yard TD run, along with Mare kicking a 32-yard field goal.  However, the 49ers tied the game with Nedney's 28-yard field goal.  In overtime, San Francisco's Nedney nailed the game-winning 40-yard field goal. Julius Jones (26 carries for 127 yards and a touchdown) got his first 100-yard game since Week 14 of 2006.",

The Steelers opened the game with a failed onside kick attempt which gave the Redskins position at their opponent's 41-yard line. The drive ended with a Shaun Suisham field goal. The Redskins regained possession on a tipped Ben Roethlisberger pass that was intercepted by Cornelius Griffin early in the first quarter. The drive resulted in another field goal giving Washington a 6-0 lead over the Steelers. In the second quarter, Steelers' Jeff Reed scored on a 35-yard field goal. Pittsburgh took the lead as they turned a blocked Ryan Plackemeier punt attempt into a 1-yard touchdown run by Roethlisberger, who exited the game following the score due to an injury to his shoulder and would not return. In the second half, Byron Leftwich entered the game for the injured Roethlisberger. Pittsburgh rusher Willie Parker ran for a touchdown in the third quarter (with a failed extra point). Early in the fourth quarter, Leftwich completed a 5-yard touchdown reception to Santonio Holmes, giving the Steelers a 23-6 lead. Jason Campbell appeared to score a rushing touchdown later in the quarter but the ruling was reversed on a Pittsburgh challenge. Byron Leftwich played for only one half and threw for 129 yards. Clinton Portis was held to 51 yards rushing. Jason Campbell was sacked seven times. His streak of avoiding an interception also ended at 249 pass attempts.",

The Steelers opened the game with a failed onside kick attempt which gave the Redskins position at their opponent's 41-yard line. The drive ended with a Shaun Suisham field goal. The Redskins regained possession on a tipped Ben Roethlisberger pass that was intercepted by Cornelius Griffin early in the first quarter. The drive resulted in another field goal giving Washington a 6-0 lead over the Steelers. In the second quarter, Steelers' Jeff Reed scored on a 35-yard field goal. Pittsburgh took the lead as they turned a blocked Ryan Plackemeier punt attempt into a 1-yard touchdown run by Roethlisberger, who exited the game following the score due to an injury to his shoulder and would not return. In the second half, Byron Leftwich entered the game for the injured Roethlisberger. Pittsburgh rusher Willie Parker ran for a touchdown in the third quarter (with a failed extra point). Early in the fourth quarter, Leftwich completed a 5-yard touchdown reception to Santonio Holmes, giving the Steelers a 23-6 lead. Jason Campbell appeared to score a rushing touchdown later in the quarter but the ruling was reversed on a Pittsburgh challenge. Byron Leftwich played for only one half and threw for 129 yards. Clinton Portis was held to 51 yards rushing. Jason Campbell was sacked seven times. His streak of avoiding an interception also ended at 249 pass attempts.",

Kansas City would score in the first quarter as rookie kicker Ryan Succop got a 23-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Raiders tied the game as kicker Sebastian Janikowski made a 48-yard field goal. Oakland would take the lead in the third quarter as Janikowski nailed a 54-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Chiefs would retake the lead as quarterback Matt Cassel completed a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Dwayne Bowe. However, the Raiders sealed the win as running back Darren McFadden got a 5-yard touchdown run.",

Then kicker Matt Prater made a 20-yard field goal to put the Broncos up 17-0. In the third quarter Seattle tried to cut the lead when QB Matt Hasselbeck completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR Ben Obomanu, but Denver scored with RB Knowshon Moreno getting a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter Seattle fell further behind when Orton found WR Demaryius Thomas on a 21-yard TD pass. Seattle would make the final score of the game when Hasselbeck scrambled 20 yards to the endzone for a touchdown.",

        "passage": " Hoping to build on their road win over the Falcons, the Browns returned home for Round 1 of their rust belt battle with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  After a scoreless first quarter, the Browns struck first as CB Daven Holly returned an interception 57 yards for a touchdown.  Later, kicker Phil Dawson completed a 23-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Steelers kicker Jeff Reed completed a 43-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the true nature of the rivalry would commence.  Dawson would give Cleveland a 35-yard field goal, but Pittsburgh responded with QB Ben Roethlisberger completing a 20-yard TD pass to rookie WR Santonio Holmes.  WR Josh Cribbs would return a kick off 92 yards for a touchdown to give the Browns a 20-10 lead.  However, the Steelers would take the lead with RB Willie Parker getting a 1-yard TD run and a 4-yard touchdown reception.  The Browns final drive of the game almost came up successful, but QB Charlie Frye's 22-yard pass to WR Braylon Edwards fell incomplete.  With the loss, Cleveland fell to last place in the AFC North at 3-7.",

After a scoreless first quarter, the Browns struck first as CB Daven Holly returned an interception 57 yards for a touchdown. Later, kicker Phil Dawson completed a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Steelers kicker Jeff Reed completed a 43-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the true nature of the rivalry would commence. Dawson would give Cleveland a 35-yard field goal, but Pittsburgh responded with QB Ben Roethlisberger completing a 20-yard TD pass to rookie WR Santonio Holmes. WR Josh Cribbs would return a kick off 92 yards for a touchdown to give the Browns a 20-10 lead. However, the Steelers would take the lead with RB Willie Parker getting a 1-yard TD run and a 4-yard touchdown reception. The Browns final drive of the game almost came up successful, but QB Charlie Frye's 22-yard pass to WR Braylon Edwards fell incomplete. With the loss, Cleveland fell to last place in the AFC North at 3-7.",

In the first quarter, Dallas trailed early as Lions RB T.J. Duckett getting a 32-yard TD run, along with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 19-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys got on the board with RB Marion Barber getting a 20-yard TD run.  Detroit would answer with Hanson kicking a 36-yard field goal, while RB Kevin Jones getting a 2-yard TD run.  The Cowboys ended the half with QB Tony Romo completing an 8-yard TD pass to Barber. In the third quarter, the Lions replied with Jones getting a 3-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas came back and took the lead with Barber getting a 1-yard TD run and Romo completing a 16-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten. With the win, the Cowboys improved to 12-1 and clinched the NFC East crown for the first time since 1998.",

The Eagles replied with QB Kevin Kolb making a 5-yard TD pass to WR Riley Cooper, followed by kicker David Akers hitting a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Titans fell further behind with Akers making a 46-yard field goal. They soon replied with kicker Rob Bironas nailing a 41-yard field goal, but the Eagles continued to score in the 4th with Akers getting a 28-yard field goal. Eventually, they rallied to take a big lead with Collins completing an 80-yard TD pass to Britt, followed by Bironas hitting a 38-yard field goal. Then Collins found Britt for the third time in the game on a 16-yard TD pass, and then Bironas made a 33-yard field goal.

        "passage": " For the fifth game of the season, the Bears visited Kansas City, who trailed the Bears 5-6 in the all-time series; the game was the first in Kansas City since 2003, which the Chiefs won 31-3. Entering the game, the Bears were plagued by injuries, with 16 players listed on the injury report: Jermon Bushrod (concussion) was ruled out, safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) was doubtful, and 13 others were questionable. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to be cautious of Bob Sutton's 3-4 defense, particularly the front five guided by linebacking duo Tamba Hali and Justin Houston. However, the pass rush only had nine sacks in 2015. To combat the defense, the Chiefs' cornerbacks had to be targeted, particularly Jamell Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters, who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and four touchdowns, respectively. Additionally, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL, and in the red zone, was ranked the worst in the league. Also, the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295.5 passing yards per game (ranked 28th in the league), while recording only two interceptions. The Bears defense, which had recorded six sacks in the last two games, faced an offensive line that allowed a league-high 19 sacks. Despite the struggles on the OL, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game, though Smith had a 49.5 completion percentage to receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the rushing attack, the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles, who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of ten yards or more in the NFL with eleven; however, Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. On special teams, facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub, the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis (kickoffs) and De'Anthony Thomas (punts); Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards. The Bears' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt, who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average, while allowing only 51 yards on the return, along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive. The Chiefs won the toss and deferred until the second half. After the Bears and Chiefs' first drives ended with punts, the Bears' next possession started at their own nine-yard line after an 18-yard punt return by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford's holding penalty. Three plays into the drive, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone, leading to a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points late in the first quarter with Robbie Gould's 44-yard field goal. The Chiefs eventually punted again, and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five-yard line; the drive stalled, and Pat O'Donnell punted from the endzone. Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles, the Bears failed to employ a pass rush during the Chiefs' next drive, and once they did on third down, Smith threw a pass to Thomas, who scored on the 19-yard play. Kansas City increased the margin to 17-3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter, with Santos' 35-yard field goal; Cutler kneeled to end the first half. On the Chiefs' first drive of the second half, the offense reached the Bears' nine-yard line, but Santos' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee, allowing the Bears to take over at their own 17. The first play of the Bears' drive was a ten-yard run by Forte for a first down, marking the Bears' first since the opening quarter, and the series concluded with Gould's 30-yard field goal. The next four drives of the game ended with punts, while one of the series, held by the Bears, concluded with a turnover on downs. With 7:51 left in the game and down 17-6, Cutler attempted to lead another comeback for the second consecutive game. The first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards, concluding with Cutler throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson in the corner of the left endzone. The Bears attempted to go for two, but Cutler's pass for Mariani was ruled out; after a challenge, the ruling was upheld. The Chiefs eventually punted again, with the Bears starting their next drive on their own 33. Cutler led the offense on an eight-play, 67-yard drive, concluding with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Forte despite dropping the snap. However, the Bears failed the two-point conversion. The Chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds left in the game. Smith reached the Bears' 48 with a pass to Maclin, and on the next play, threw a nine-yard pass to Maclin. However, Maclin juggled the pass while going out of bounds. As a result, with two seconds left, the Chiefs elected to try a NFL record 66-yard field goal. However, Santos' kick fell short, giving the Bears the 18-17 win. This was Chicago's first victory at Arrowhead since 1993 where the Bears won 19-17. Two team records were set during the game. After converting his second field goal of the game, Gould became the leader of the most points in franchise history with 1,168 points, surpassing Kevin Butler. The win was Cutler's 46th with the Bears, tying Jim McMahon for the most in team history.",

        "cleaned_passage": "For the fifth game of the season, the Bears visited Kansas City, who trailed the Bears 5-6 in the all-time series; the game was the first in Kansas City since 2003, which the Chiefs won 31-3. Entering the game, the Bears were plagued by injuries, with 16 players listed on the injury report: Jermon Bushrod (concussion) was ruled out, safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) was doubtful, and 13 others were questionable. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to be cautious of Bob Sutton's 3-4 defense, particularly the front five guided by linebacking duo Tamba Hali and Justin Houston. However, the pass rush only had nine sacks in 2015. To combat the defense, the Chiefs' cornerbacks had to be targeted, particularly Jamell Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters, who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and four touchdowns, respectively. Additionally, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL, and in the red zone, was ranked the worst in the league. Also, the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295.5 passing yards per game (ranked 28th in the league), while recording only two interceptions. The Bears defense, which had recorded six sacks in the last two games, faced an offensive line that allowed a league-high 19 sacks. Despite the struggles on the OL, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game, though Smith had a 49.5 completion percentage to receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the rushing attack, the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles, who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of ten yards or more in the NFL with eleven; however, Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. On special teams, facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub, the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis (kickoffs) and De'Anthony Thomas (punts); Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards. The Bears' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt, who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average, while allowing only 51 yards on the return, along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive. The Chiefs won the toss and deferred until the second half. After the Bears and Chiefs' first drives ended with punts, the Bears' next possession started at their own nine-yard line after an 18-yard punt return by Marc Mariani was nullified by Jeremy Langford's holding penalty. Three plays into the drive, Chiefs Jaye Howard and Allen Bailey sacked Jay Cutler in the endzone, leading to a fumble that was recovered by Ramik Wilson and gave the Chiefs the touchdown. After getting the ball back, the Bears were able to score three points late in the first quarter with Robbie Gould's 44-yard field goal. The Chiefs eventually punted again, and the Bears were again pinned inside their own five-yard line; the drive stalled, and Pat O'Donnell punted from the endzone. Despite playing a team with offensive line struggles, the Bears failed to employ a pass rush during the Chiefs' next drive, and once they did on third down, Smith threw a pass to Thomas, who scored on the 19-yard play. Kansas City increased the margin to 17-3 with nine seconds left in the second quarter, with Santos' 35-yard field goal; Cutler kneeled to end the first half. On the Chiefs' first drive of the second half, the offense reached the Bears' nine-yard line, but Santos' field goal was blocked by Pernell McPhee, allowing the Bears to take over at their own 17. The first play of the Bears' drive was a ten-yard run by Forte for a first down, marking the Bears' first since the opening quarter, and the series concluded with Gould's 30-yard field goal. The next four drives of the game ended with punts, while one of the series, held by the Bears, concluded with a turnover on downs. With 7:51 left in the game and down 17-6, Cutler attempted to lead another comeback for the second consecutive game. The first drive lasted eleven plays and 88 yards, concluding with Cutler throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson in the corner of the left endzone. The Bears attempted to go for two, but Cutler's pass for Mariani was ruled out; after a challenge, the ruling was upheld. The Chiefs eventually punted again, with the Bears starting their next drive on their own 33. Cutler led the offense on an eight-play, 67-yard drive, concluding with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Forte despite dropping the snap. However, the Bears failed the two-point conversion. The Chiefs started their final drive on their own 33 with eleven seconds left in the game. Smith reached the Bears' 48 with a pass to Maclin, and on the next play, threw a nine-yard pass to Maclin. However, Maclin juggled the pass while going out of bounds. As a result, with two seconds left, the Chiefs elected to try a NFL record 66-yard field goal. However, Santos' kick fell short, giving the Bears the 18-17 win. This was Chicago's first victory at Arrowhead since 1993 where the Bears won 19-17. Two team records were set during the game. After converting his second field goal of the game, Gould became the leader of the most points in franchise history with 1,168 points, surpassing Kevin Butler. The win was Cutler's 46th with the Bears, tying Jim McMahon for the most in team history.",

Houston delivered the opening shot of the first quarter with kicker Kris Brown's 26-yard field goal, followed by the Raiders tying the game with a 46-yard field goal from kicker Sebastian Janikowski.  The Texans would take full command in the second quarter as Brown nailed a 34-yard field goal, followed by running back Steve Slaton getting a 32-yard touchdown run and catching an 18-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Matt Schaub.  Oakland would close out the half with Janikowski's 33-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Houston would continue its domination with rookie linebacker Brian Cushing tackling Raiders running back Justin Fargas in his own endzone for a safety, immediately followed by wide receiver Jacoby Jones returning a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown.",

The Bengals would continue their dominating day in the second quarter as Palmer found tight end J.P. Foschi on a 3-yard touchdown pass and wide receiver Laveranues Coles on an 8-yard touchdown pass, followed by kicker Shayne Graham booting a 29-yard field goal.  The Bears would close out the half with a 22-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould. Afterwards, Cincinnati would pull away Palmer finding Ochocinco again on a 13-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter, followed by former Chicago running back Cedric Benson's 1-yard touchdown run.  The Bears would then end the game with quarterback Jay Cutler hooking up with wide receiver Devin Hester on a 5-yard touchdown pass. With the win, the Bengals went into their bye week at 5-2.

In the first quarter, Houston drew first blood as QB Sage Rosenfels got a 5-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Broncos got on the board with kicker Jason Elam getting a 41-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Texans responded with kicker Kris Brown getting a 41-yard field goal.  Denver would end the half as Elam nailed a 47-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston replied with RB Ron Dayne getting a 6-yard TD run.  Denver would answer with QB Jay Cutler completing a 12-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler.  In the fourth quarter, the Texans pulled away as Rosenfels completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, while FB Vonta Leach managed to get a 1-yard TD run. With the win, Houston improved to 7-7. The game marked the only appearance of the Texans on primetime television of the season, their first since 2005, and the first game in 2007 played with the roof open.",

Philadelphia trailed early in the first quarter as Panthers running back DeAngelo Williams ran 11 yards for a Carolina touchdown on their first drive.  The Eagles answered with a 49-yard field goal from kicker David Akers. In the second quarter, Philadelphia exploded with points as defensive end Victor Abiamiri returned a fumble 2 yards for a touchdown, wide receiver DeSean Jackson returned a punt 85 yards for a touchdown, and quarterback Donovan McNabb completed a 9-yard TD pass to tight end Brent Celek and a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook. Carolina ended the period with kicker John Kasay booting a 22-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Eagles closed out their scoring with McNabb scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run.  However, he was hit late by several Carolina tacklers who cracked his ribs on the right side, knocking him out of the game. Kevin Kolb came in for McNabb and closed out the game for the victorious Eagles.",

        "passage": " Coming off their miraculous comeback in San Diego and subsequent bye week, the Broncos returned home for an interconference duel against the New Orleans Saints. The Broncos grabbed the lead in the first quarter, with running back Willis McGahee rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. On the Broncos' next possession, McGahee committed a fumble, and the Saints responded early in the second quarter, with quarterback Drew Brees throwing his 300th career touchdown pass&#8212;a 29-yarder to running back Darren Sproles. On the Saints' next possession, Brees was intercepted by linebacker Wesley Woodyard, and the Broncos dominated the remainder of the game. Quarterback Peyton Manning tossed a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Decker and placekicker Matt Prater nailed a 33-yard field goal to close out the first half. The Broncos increased their lead in the third quarter, with Manning connecting on a 1-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, then pulled away in the fourth quarter, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Decker and another 33-yard field goal by Prater. The Saints scored a late touchdown, with Brees connecting on an 18-yard pass to wide receiver Jimmy Graham, but the game had already been decided in the Broncos' favor. Linebacker Joe Mays suffered a fractured fibula on a kickoff return during the fourth quarter, and was placed on the season-ending injured reserve the following day (October 29). Drew Brees surpassed John Elway for sixth on the NFL's all-time list for touchdown passes. However, Brees' personal record dropped to 0-7 in games played at Denver.",

Pittsburgh would deliver the opening punch in the first quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Rashard Mendenhall.  The Ravens would take the lead in the second quarter as running back Willis McGahee got a 9-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker Billy Cundiff getting a 33-yard field goal.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Steelers would regain the lead as Mendenhall picked up a 7-yard touchdown run.  However, Baltimore would get the last laugh as quarterback Joe Flacco completed an 18-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh with 33&#160;seconds remaining. The Steelers would get the ball back with 20&#160;seconds remaining but quarterback Charlie Batch threw a pass that was picked off by linebacker Ray Lewis, effectively ending the game. With the loss, Pittsburgh went into their bye week at 3-1.",

        "passage": " Coming off their overtime win at San Diego, the Broncos traveled to the Mall of America Field at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome for an interconference duel with the Minnesota Vikings. The game's first points came from the Vikings, when defensive end Jared Allen tackled running back Willis McGahee in the end zone for a safety. The Broncos grabbed the lead when linebacker Mario Haggan returned an interception off Vikings' quarterback Christian Ponder 16 yards for a touchdown. Vikings' kicker Ryan Longwell made a 40-yard field goal, then the Vikings reclaimed the lead in the second quarter, on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Ponder to tight end Kyle Rudolph, followed by another field goal by Longwell, this time from 25 yards, just before halftime. The Broncos narrowed Minnesota's lead in the third quarter, with a 21-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tim Tebow to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, but the Vikings countered with a 52-yard touchdown pass from Ponder to wide receiver Percy Harvin. The Broncos responded with a 41-yard touchdown pass from Tebow to Thomas. Ponder then threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Harvin to give Minnesota a 29-21 lead. On the Broncos' next possession, McGahee rushed 24 yards for a touchdown and Tebow scrambled for a two-point conversion to tie the game at 29. The Vikings subsequently reclaimed the lead on Longwell's 39-yard field goal with 3:06 left in the game. The Broncos answered with kicker Matt Prater's 46-yard field goal with 1:33 left to tie the game at 32. On the Vikings' ensuing possession, Broncos' cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman returned an interception off Ponder to the Vikings' 15-yard line. Six plays later, Prater nailed the game-winning 23-yard field goal as time expired to give the Broncos their fifth consecutive win.",

Humphrey Metrodome for an interconference duel with the Minnesota Vikings. The game's first points came from the Vikings, when defensive end Jared Allen tackled running back Willis McGahee in the end zone for a safety. The Broncos grabbed the lead when linebacker Mario Haggan returned an interception off Vikings' quarterback Christian Ponder 16 yards for a touchdown. Vikings' kicker Ryan Longwell made a 40-yard field goal, then the Vikings reclaimed the lead in the second quarter, on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Ponder to tight end Kyle Rudolph, followed by another field goal by Longwell, this time from 25 yards, just before halftime. The Broncos narrowed Minnesota's lead in the third quarter, with a 21-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tim Tebow to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, but the Vikings countered with a 52-yard touchdown pass from Ponder to wide receiver Percy Harvin. The Broncos responded with a 41-yard touchdown pass from Tebow to Thomas. Ponder then threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Harvin to give Minnesota a 29-21 lead. On the Broncos' next possession, McGahee rushed 24 yards for a touchdown and Tebow scrambled for a two-point conversion to tie the game at 29. The Vikings subsequently reclaimed the lead on Longwell's 39-yard field goal with 3:06 left in the game. The Broncos answered with kicker Matt Prater's 46-yard field goal with 1:33 left to tie the game at 32. On the Vikings' ensuing possession, Broncos' cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman returned an interception off Ponder to the Vikings' 15-yard line. Six plays later, Prater nailed the game-winning 23-yard field goal as time expired to give the Broncos their fifth consecutive win.",

After both teams missed a field goal to open the game, Green Bay got on the board first with a 6-yard run by rookie DeShawn Wynn. The Giants responded with a 26-yard scoring strike by Eli Manning to Plaxico Burress. The Giants got a Lawrence Tynes field goal and a 10-7 half time lead. In the second half, the Packers drove 51 yards to start the second half. Favre capped off the scoring drive with a 2-yard pass to Bubba Franks for a 14-10 lead the Packers would not relinquish. The Giants responded with another drive but once again, an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, this one on Amani Toomer, hurt the Giants. Tynes kicked a second field goal, pulling the Giants to within one. With the loss, the Giants would fall to 0-2 for the first time since 1996.",

After a scoreless first quarter, the Panthers pounced first as kicker John Kasay got a 44-yard field goal.  The Chargers would take the lead with QB Philip Rivers completing a 44-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, yet Carolina would take the halftime lead as Kasay nailed a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, San Diego got the lead with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 27-yard field goal, yet the Panthers regained the lead with CB Chris Gamble returning a fumble 31 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, Carolina increased its lead with Kasay nailing a 49-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Chargers got the lead again with Rivers completing a 24-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates and a 5-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson.  Unfortunately for San Diego, Panthers QB Jake Delhomme threw the game-winning 14-yard TD pass to TE Dante Rosario as time expired. With the surprising loss, San Diego began its season at 0-1.",

Jeff Reed nailed a field goal before the half to draw the Steelers within 10, and hit another in the third to bring them within a touchdown. However, a scoreless fourth by both teams led the Browns to their first win against the Steelers since 2003, and the Browns became only the fourth team in NFL history to be at least 10 games under .500 and defeat the defending Super Bowl champions. With the win, the Browns improved to 2-11, snapped a twelve-game losing streak against the Steelers and won against them for the first time since 2003 when they defeated the team 33-13 in Pittsburgh.

Due to Matt Flynn's performance the previous week, he replaces Scott Tolzien and makes his first start for the Packers in the 2013 season. The Lions' opening possession ended at the Green Bay 12 when Clay Matthews forced a Reggie Bush fumble that was recovered by Morgan Burnett. However, the Packers could not capitalize, and the Lions drew first blood with a 27-yard field goal. Following a kickoff that went out-of-bounds, the Packers answered with a 54-yard field goal to tie it at 3-3. The Packers quickly struck again when Nick Perry forced a Matthew Stafford fumble that was returned by Morgan Burnett for a TD for a 10-3 lead. The Lions answered by scoring two TDs, first a 5-yard TD pass to Jeremy Ross, then a 1-yard run by Reggie Bush. Detroit had opportunities for more points before the half, but David Akers missed a 31-yard field goal as the 1st half expired, keeping a 17-10 lead. Following a 3-and-out on Green Bay's opening possession in the 3rd quarter, the Lions scored on a 20-yard TD pass to Calvin Johnson, extending their lead 24-10. Late in the 3rd quarter, Ndamukong Suh sacked Matt Flynn in the endzone, forcing a safety that made it 26-10. The Lions capitalized on their next possession with a 1-yard run by Joique Bell. They followed that up with a 20-yard TD pass to Kevin Ogletree, which extended their lead 40-10. The Packers tried to rally with a 56-yard pass to James Jones, but Matt Flynn fumbled the snap on the next play, and Detroit recovered and ran out the clock. This loss marked Matthew Stafford's first career win against the Packers. It also snapped the Lions' 10-year losing streak on Thanksgiving Day. With the loss, the Packers fell to 5-6-1.",

In the first quarter, the Redskins trailed early as Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook for the only score in the quarter. In the second quarter, the Redskins took the lead when quarterback Jason Campbell hooked up with wide receiver James Thrash on a 4-yard touchdown pass (with a failed PAT) and a 12-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion). In the third quarter, the Redskins increased their lead with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 23-yard field goal. Philadelphia managed to draw close with McNabb completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end L.J. Smith (with a failed 2-point conversion). In the fourth quarter, the Redskins padded its lead with Campbell completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan McCardell, yet the Eagles answered with McNabb's 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Brown. The Redskins tried to pull away as Suisham nailed a 21-yard field goal. However, Philadelphia sealed the win with Westbrook turning a 57-yard reception and a 10-yard run into touchdowns. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 5-4. This would turn out to be Sean Taylor's last game that he would ever play in: He sustained an injury that kept him from playing in the last two games before his death.",

        "cleaned_passage": "Coming off their overtime road win over the Jets, the Redskins went home for an NFC East rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles. In the first quarter, the Redskins trailed early as Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb completed a 4-yard touchdown pass to running back Brian Westbrook for the only score in the quarter. In the second quarter, the Redskins took the lead when quarterback Jason Campbell hooked up with wide receiver James Thrash on a 4-yard touchdown pass (with a failed PAT) and a 12-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion). In the third quarter, the Redskins increased their lead with kicker Shaun Suisham getting a 23-yard field goal. Philadelphia managed to draw close with McNabb completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end L.J. Smith (with a failed 2-point conversion). In the fourth quarter, the Redskins padded its lead with Campbell completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Keenan McCardell, yet the Eagles answered with McNabb's 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Brown. The Redskins tried to pull away as Suisham nailed a 21-yard field goal. However, Philadelphia sealed the win with Westbrook turning a 57-yard reception and a 10-yard run into touchdowns. With the loss, the Redskins fell to 5-4. This would turn out to be Sean Taylor's last game that he would ever play in: He sustained an injury that kept him from playing in the last two games before his death.",

        "passage": " Willie Parker missed his fourth game due to a knee injury. Santonio Holmes also missed the game after a \"small quantity of marijuana\" was found in his car and the team placed him on the inactive list. Mewelde Moore opened up the game's scoring with a 32-yard touchdown run on the Steelers opening drive. The 5-1 New York Giants responded with a field goal on the ensuing drive. Pittsburgh stopped the Giants on four consecutive plays from inside the Steelers 2-yard line to force a turnover on downs. But were unable to score when two Ben Roethlisberger interceptions and a punt lead to two more field goals in the second quarter for the Giants. At 10:10 of the third quarter Roethlisberger completed a 65-yard touchdown pass to Nate Washington to give the Steelers a 14-9 lead. Later in the quarter, a Steelers 53-yard touchdown pass was negated due to a holding penalty and Pittsburgh was forced to punt. In the final quarter Pittsburgh kept New York out of the end zone on three plays inside the 10-yard line, however, the Giants connected on a field goal to bring the Giants to within two points. On the next drive, James Harrison&#8212;who was called in to replace injured long snapper Greg Warren&#8212;snapped the ball out of the end zone to give the Giants a safety and tie the game. The Giants drove after receiving the safety's kickoff to score a touchdown&#8212;taking a 21-14 lead with 3:07 remaining. Pittsburgh was unable to convert on their final two drives, as Roethlisberger threw his fourth interception of the day.",

In the first quarter, the Broncos took the early lead, as quarterback Kyle Orton completed a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal, followed in the second quarter by a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Correll Buckhalter and a 20-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. The Seahawks got on the board in the third quarter, when quarterback Matt Hasselbeck completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Ben Obomanu, but the Broncos replied with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Knowshon Moreno. The Broncos increased their lead in the fourth quarter, when Orton threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. The Seahawks replied, with Hasselbeck scrambling 20 yards for a touchdown, but the Broncos' lead was too much for Seattle to overcome.",

In the first quarter the Chargers trailed early as RB Arian Foster got an 8-yard TD run. They soon replied with QB Philip Rivers making a 55-yard TD pass to WR Seyi Ajirotutu. They trailed again with kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 27-yard field goal, but took the lead after Rivers got an 11-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael. They fell behind again in the second quarter as Foster made a 2-yard TD run, followed by Rackers hitting a 21 and a 25-yard field goal. The Chargers eventually pulled themselves in front again, with Rivers finding McMichael again on a 12-yard TD pass. This was followed in the 4th quarter by Rivers' 28-yard TD pass to Ajirotutu (With a successful 2-point conversion as FB Mike Tolbert ran to the endzone). With the win, the Chargers went into their bye week at 4-5.",

Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Jacksonville wasted no time tacking onto their lead, with Leftwich completing passes to Reggie Williams and George Wrighster for long gains. Taylor would then score on a 13-yard touchdown run for a 14-0 Jaguars lead. Early in the second quarter, the Jets attempted a punt, but the Jaguars' Gerald Sensabaugh blocked it, and Jorge Cordova recovered at the Jets' 8-yard line. Three plays later, Jones-Drew scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, surviving a challenge by the Jets. It only snowballed from there, as Pennington was intercepted by Terry Cousin on the next possession, and Leftwich flipped a 1-yard touchdown pass to Wrighster. Jacksonville would add a Josh Scobee 43-yard field goal early in the second half, and after Deon Grant intercepted Pennington, Leftwich threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Williams for a 38-0 lead. The Jets' lone scoring chance in the second half was stopped when Leon Washington was stuffed on a 4th-and-goal from the Jaguars' 1-yard line early in the fourth quarter. The Jets were stopped on fourth down on their next possession when Pennington's scramble fell a yard short, and Scobee added a 40-yard field goal to close the scoring. On the Jets' final possession, backup rookie quarterback Kellen Clemens made his first appearance under center, but the drive ended badly when he was sacked by Montavious Stanley and Nick Greisen recovered.",

        "cleaned_passage": "For the third straight week, the game got off to an ominous start for the Jets, as Chad Pennington was intercepted by Brian Williams on the Jets' first possession. Byron Leftwich then completed a short pass to Fred Taylor, who turned it into a 32-yard gain. Two plays later, Maurice Jones-Drew scored on a 6-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Jacksonville wasted no time tacking onto their lead, with Leftwich completing passes to Reggie Williams and George Wrighster for long gains. Taylor would then score on a 13-yard touchdown run for a 14-0 Jaguars lead. Early in the second quarter, the Jets attempted a punt, but the Jaguars' Gerald Sensabaugh blocked it, and Jorge Cordova recovered at the Jets' 8-yard line. Three plays later, Jones-Drew scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, surviving a challenge by the Jets. It only snowballed from there, as Pennington was intercepted by Terry Cousin on the next possession, and Leftwich flipped a 1-yard touchdown pass to Wrighster. Jacksonville would add a Josh Scobee 43-yard field goal early in the second half, and after Deon Grant intercepted Pennington, Leftwich threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Williams for a 38-0 lead. The Jets' lone scoring chance in the second half was stopped when Leon Washington was stuffed on a 4th-and-goal from the Jaguars' 1-yard line early in the fourth quarter. The Jets were stopped on fourth down on their next possession when Pennington's scramble fell a yard short, and Scobee added a 40-yard field goal to close the scoring. On the Jets' final possession, backup rookie quarterback Kellen Clemens made his first appearance under center, but the drive ended badly when he was sacked by Montavious Stanley and Nick Greisen recovered.",

The Patriots took the early lead, with a 39-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski, before placekicker and former Patriots Super Bowl hero Adam Vinateri hit back with a 31-yard field goal of his own early in the second quarter. The Patriots then reeled off 28 unanswered points, starting with quarterback Tom Brady tossing an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski, a 1-yard touchdown run by running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis just before halftime, then Brady threw two more touchdown passes to Gronkowski in the third quarter - a 21-yarder followed by a 2-yarder. In the fourth quarter, the Patriots were held scoreless and the Colts reeled off 21 unanswered points - a 5-yard touchdown run by running back Donald Brown, followed by two touchdown passes from Dan Orlovsky to wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on - a 33-yarder and a 12-yarder - the latter with 36 seconds remaining in regulation. Despite the touchdowns, one of Gar&#231;on's catches in the end zone was accompanied with an angry throw at a sign with a target meant for Gronkowski's trademark spike. A Colts' onside kick attempt near the end of the contest was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Patriots.",

        "cleaned_passage": "Coming off their win over the Eagles, the Patriots returned home for an AFC duel with the Indianapolis Colts. The Patriots took the early lead, with a 39-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski, before placekicker and former Patriots Super Bowl hero Adam Vinateri hit back with a 31-yard field goal of his own early in the second quarter. The Patriots then reeled off 28 unanswered points, starting with quarterback Tom Brady tossing an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob Gronkowski, a 1-yard touchdown run by running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis just before halftime, then Brady threw two more touchdown passes to Gronkowski in the third quarter - a 21-yarder followed by a 2-yarder. In the fourth quarter, the Patriots were held scoreless and the Colts reeled off 21 unanswered points - a 5-yard touchdown run by running back Donald Brown, followed by two touchdown passes from Dan Orlovsky to wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on - a 33-yarder and a 12-yarder - the latter with 36 seconds remaining in regulation. Despite the touchdowns, one of Gar&#231;on's catches in the end zone was accompanied with an angry throw at a sign with a target meant for Gronkowski's trademark spike. A Colts' onside kick attempt near the end of the contest was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Patriots.",

In the first quarter the 49ers took the lead as QB Alex Smith got a 1-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. The lead was cut when kicker John Kasay nailed a 47-yard field goal. The 49ers scored with kicker Joe Nedney making a 24-yard field goal. The Panthers tied the game with QB Matt Moore completing an 18-yard TD pass to WR David Gettis. The 49ers fell behind in the third quarter with Kasay booting a 55-yard field goal. They eventually got the lead back in the fourth quarter with Nedney hitting a 38-yard field goal, and with DE Ray McDonald returning an interception 31 yards for a touchdown. However, the Panthers tied the game with Moore finding Gettis again on a 23-yarrd TD pass. Following an interception by 49ers backup quarterback David Carr, Kasay successfully booted a 37-yard field goal to give the 49ers the loss.",

The Texans used Dayne and rookie Chris Taylor to eat up the clock and exploit the Colts' suspect run defense, ranked last in the NFL, while taking pressure off David Carr and the struggling passing game. The win broke a nine-game losing streak to the Colts (11-4). It would be the Colts' last defeat before winning Super Bowl XLI. Mario Williams forced a Dominic Rhodes fumble on the Colts' second play. Anthony Weaver recovered the ball on the Indianapolis 47 and Houston would convert it into a touchdown, taking an early 14-0 lead. Houston led through most of the game until Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison connected for their second touchdown, a 7-yard pass that tied it 24-24 with 2:41 remaining. Carr and the Texans then engineered a six-play, 31-yard drive that ended with Brown's winning kick. Carr was 16-of-23 for 163 yards and a touchdown and was not sacked.",

The win broke a nine-game losing streak to the Colts (11-4). It would be the Colts' last defeat before winning Super Bowl XLI. Mario Williams forced a Dominic Rhodes fumble on the Colts' second play. Anthony Weaver recovered the ball on the Indianapolis 47 and Houston would convert it into a touchdown, taking an early 14-0 lead. Houston led through most of the game until Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison connected for their second touchdown, a 7-yard pass that tied it 24-24 with 2:41 remaining. Carr and the Texans then engineered a six-play, 31-yard drive that ended with Brown's winning kick. Carr was 16-of-23 for 163 yards and a touchdown and was not sacked.",

Houston would trail early in the first quarter as Colts quarterback Peyton Manning found running back Joseph Addai on a 7-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 22-yard field goal from kicker Matt Stover.  Indianapolis would increase their lead in the second quarter with Stover's 37-yard field goal, yet the Texans closed out the half with kicker Kris Brown nailing a 56-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston began to gain ground as quarterback Matt Schaub completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Ryan Moats.  The Texans would take the lead in the fourth quarter as running back Steve Slaton got a 1-yard touchdown run, but the Colts retook the lead with running back Joseph Addai getting a 2-yard touchdown run.  Houston had a chance to tie the game with one second left in regulation, but Brown's 42-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left. In what was another close game resulting in a tough loss, the Texans went into their bye week at 5-4.",

        "passage": " Hoping to rebound from their embarrassing home loss to the Lions, the Raiders flew to Invesco Field at Mile High for an AFC West duel with the Denver Broncos.  In the first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Broncos QB Jay Cutler completed a 9-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Stokley for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Raiders got on the board with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 38-yard field goal.  However, Denver continued to pound away as RB Cecil Sapp got a 4-yard TD run, while kicker Jason Elam got a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Oakland began to come back as QB Josh McCown (who was a gametime decision heading into the game) completed a 46-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Raiders took the lead as DT Gerard Warren sacked Cutler in the end zone for a safety, while LB Thomas Howard returned an interception 44 yards for a touchdown (followed by a successful two-point conversion pass from McCown to WR Ronald Curry).  However, the Broncos tied the game up with Elam's 20-yard field goal.  In overtime, Oakland managed to make Denver go three-and-out on their first possession.  A 33-yard run by RB LaMont Jordan helped set up Janikowski for a game-winning 52-yard field goal. Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan called timeout before the kick could begin.  Janikowski's second try hit off the very tip of the left goal post and was no good, giving Denver a chance to win the game.  The Broncos won with Elam getting a 23-yard field goal. With the loss, not only did the Raiders fall to 0-2, but they had lost 11-straight games (currently the NFL's longest losing streak) dating back to Week 9 of the 2006 season.",

In the second quarter, the Raiders got on the board with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 38-yard field goal. However, Denver continued to pound away as RB Cecil Sapp got a 4-yard TD run, while kicker Jason Elam got a 23-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Oakland began to come back as QB Josh McCown (who was a gametime decision heading into the game) completed a 46-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Raiders took the lead as DT Gerard Warren sacked Cutler in the end zone for a safety, while LB Thomas Howard returned an interception 44 yards for a touchdown (followed by a successful two-point conversion pass from McCown to WR Ronald Curry). However, the Broncos tied the game up with Elam's 20-yard field goal. In overtime, Oakland managed to make Denver go three-and-out on their first possession. A 33-yard run by RB LaMont Jordan helped set up Janikowski for a game-winning 52-yard field goal. Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan called timeout before the kick could begin. Janikowski's second try hit off the very tip of the left goal post and was no good, giving Denver a chance to win the game. The Broncos won with Elam getting a 23-yard field goal. With the loss, not only did the Raiders fall to 0-2, but they had lost 11-straight games (currently the NFL's longest losing streak) dating back to Week 9 of the 2006 season.",

The Dolphins' deficit would increase in the second quarter as Sanchez hooked up with Keller again on a 3-yard touchdown pass.  Miami would respond with quarterback Chad Henne completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end Anthony Fasano, followed by kicker Dan Carpenter making a 44-yard field goal. The Dolphins would take the lead in the third quarter as Henne connected with wide receiver Brandon Marshall on an 11-yard touchdown pass, but New York would immediately respond as Sanchez found wide receiver Braylon Edwards on a 67-yard touchdown pass.  Miami would answer with Carpenter's 20-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets would add onto their lead as kicker Nick Folk got a 30-yard field goal.  The Dolphins would chip away as their deficit as Carpenter booted a 50-yard field goal, but New York would pull away as running back LaDainian Tomlinson got a 1-yard touchdown run.

After a scoreless first quarter, New Orleans got the game's inaugural points in the second quarter with running back Reggie Bush getting a 3-yard touchdown run. The Rams would respond with quarterback Marc Bulger completing a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donnie Avery. New Orleans would answer with quarterback Drew Brees hooking up with Bush on a 15-yard touchdown pass, yet St. Louis would close out the half with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Steven Jackson. The Saints would begin the third quarter with wide receiver Courtney Roby returning the second half's opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. The Rams would stay close with kicker Josh Brown nailing a 32-yard field goal. New Orleans would extend their lead in the fourth quarter Brees finding wide receiver Robert Meachem on a 27-yard touchdown pass. St. Louis tried to catch up as Bulger found Avery again on a 19-yard touchdown pass (with a failed 2-point conversion), yet the defense prevented the Rams from getting any closer.",

        "passage": " Still trying to get their first win of the year, the Dolphins went home for a Week 13 AFC East rematch with the throwback-clad New York Jets.  In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Jets RB Leon Washington got an 18-yard TD run.  The Dolphins ended the period with kicker Jay Feely getting a 53-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Miami drew closer as Feely kicked a 44-yard field goal, yet New York replied with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 29-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Dolphins took the lead as CB Michael Lehan returned a fumble 43 yards for a touchdown.  However, the Jets regained the lead with QB Kellen Clemens completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR Brad Smith, along with Nugent kicking a 40-yarder and a 35-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New York increased their lead with Nugent kicking a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets sealed the win with RB Thomas Jones getting a 1-yard TD run, Nugent nailing a 26-yard field goal, and Washington getting a 12-yard TD run. With the loss, Miami fell to 0-12, and have lost 15 straight games dating back to game 14 of last season. This also marked the first time since the 2001 Detroit Lions that a team began a season 0-12.",

In the first quarter, New Orleans drew first blood as QB Drew Brees completed a 25-yard TD pass to WR David Patten.  The Falcons would respond with QB Chris Redman completing a 33-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White.  In the second quarter, the Saints started to pull away as kicker Olindo Mare managed to get a 23-yard field goal, while Brees completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Marques Colston. In the third quarter, New Orleans pulled away as Brees hooked up with Colston again on a 2-yard TD pass, while Safety Roman Harper returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, Atlanta would get their last strike of the game as Redman completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Michael Jenkins.  The Saints would wrap up their victory with Mare nailing a 36-yard field goal. With their second-straight season-sweeping win over the Falcons, New Orleans improved to 6-7.",

        "passage": " Returning to Soldier Field for week four, the Bears hosted the Oakland Raiders, who held a 7-6 all-time lead entering the game. This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25-20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O'Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. The Raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half. The Bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. After the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next drive, Carr's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte's fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski's 41-yard field goal. With 2:05 left in the game, Cutler began leading a two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, followed by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On the next set of downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22-20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win. Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger for the most in team history. The field goal was Gould's eleventh career game-winner. Forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8,071, becoming the 14th player in NFL history to record 8,000 and 3,500 career rushing and receiving yards, respectively, while becoming the second-fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games. The win would be the only home win for the Bears all season, finishing the year with a horrific 1-7 home record. The Bears would finish 3-13 at home in both 2014 and 2015 combined.",

        "cleaned_passage": "Returning to Soldier Field for week four, the Bears hosted the Oakland Raiders, who held a 7-6 all-time lead entering the game. This was the first game between the two at Soldier Field since 2003, where the Bears won 24-21, and the first since 2011, when the Raiders won 25-20 in Oakland. The Bears offense faced a defense led by defensive end Khalil Mack, while the secondary is guided by 39-year old Charles Woodson, who possessed 61 career interceptions, and had sealed the Raiders' win the previous week against the Browns. However, the Raiders had struggled against tight ends, allowing five catches of at least 25 yards, with a total of 20 catches for 298 yards and five touchdowns across the first three games. On defense, Chicago was against quarterback Derek Carr, who led the Raiders offense to 74 combined points in the last two games, along with rookie receiver Amari Cooper, who had 20 receptions entering the game, while also recording a 68-yard touchdown in week two. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears had to prevent the Raiders from gaining yardage after touching the ball; the Raiders were seventh in yards after the catch, while Latavius Murray - who had recorded 139 rushing yards in week three, was ranked fourth in the league in rushing yards and was leading the AFC in yards per carry with 4.8 - ranked fifth in yards after contact. Cooper had 177 yards after the catch, the second-most in the league among wide receivers, while 53.7 percent of Carr's passing yards occurred due to these plays. In comparison, the Bears allowed the fewest yards after contact. David Fales, punter Patrick O'Donnell, Alshon Jeffery, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, tackle Jermon Bushrod and nose tackle Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. The Raiders won the coin toss and deferred in the second half. The Bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his squib kick bounced out of bounds. After the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next drive, Carr's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte's fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski's 41-yard field goal. With 2:05 left in the game, Cutler began leading a two-minute drill: after a six-yard run by Forte, followed by a sack by Mack and incomplete pass to Josh Bellamy to bring up fourth down, Cutler successfully converted with a seven-yard pass to Bennett, who beat Keenan Lambert. Cutler's next pass to Marquess Wilson fell incomplete, and Forte's seven-yard run led to another third-down situation, which led to Cutler's first-down conversion of seven yards to Wilson with 56 seconds left. On the next set of downs, Cutler's pass for receiver Cameron Meredith was overthrown, though a 12-yard pass to Royal allowed the offense to enter Oakland territory, where the Bears elected to use a timeout with 40 seconds remaining. The offense entered field goal range with Cutler's nine-yard pass to Wilson, followed by a two-yard run by Forte. With seven seconds left, the Bears used another timeout, and allowed Gould to attempt the 49-yard field goal; Gould successfully converted the field goal with two seconds remaining on the clock to give the Bears the 22-20 lead. In an last-second attempt to score, the Raiders attempted lateral passes on the kickoff return, but were penalized for an illegal lateral in the early stages of the play, and the Bears eventually recovered to clinch the win. Gould was later named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger for the most in team history. The field goal was Gould's eleventh career game-winner. Forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8,071, becoming the 14th player in NFL history to record 8,000 and 3,500 career rushing and receiving yards, respectively, while becoming the second-fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games. The win would be the only home win for the Bears all season, finishing the year with a horrific 1-7 home record. The Bears would finish 3-13 at home in both 2014 and 2015 combined.",

        "passage": " After back-to-back losses to begin the season, the Colts faced their AFC South rival, the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Colts opened the game on offense and put together a twelve play, 50-yard drive that ended in an Adam Vinatieri field goal, giving the Colts an early 3-0 lead. Following a three and out forced by the Colts defense, Andrew Luck again drove the offense down the field, this time scoring on a touchdown throw Ahmad Bradshaw, extending the Colts' lead to 10-0 at the end of the first quarter. The Colts again extended their lead early in the second quarter on a pass from Luck to Dwayne Allen. The Jaguars were again stopped by the Colts defense on their next offensive possession, with the Colts defense preventing the Jaguars for converting a first down on their first three possessions. The Colts' offense, though they would deep into Jaguars' territory, were forced to settle for Vinatieri field goals on their next two offensive possessions, giving them a 23-0 lead. After a fumble recovery by Darius Butler late in the first half, they were set up with good field position in Jaguars territory. A Luck touchdown pass to Coby Fleener extended the Colts' lead to 30-0 at halftime. After struggling to move the ball in the first half, the Jaguars replaced quarterback Chad Henne with rookie Blake Bortles. The Jaguars were able to convert a first down on their first drive of the half, though they were forced to punt following a penalty that sent them back to midfield. On the Jaguars' next possession, they again drove into Colts' territory, enough to get their first points of the game on a 41-yard field goal from Josh Scobee. At the end of the third quarter, the Colts continued to hold a commanding 30-3 lead. The Colts scored their first points of the second half on a pass from Luck to Hakeem Nicks early in the fourth quarter. Bortles threw his first career touchdown pass on the Jaguars' next possession, throwing it to Allen Hurns. With the large lead late in the game, the Colts replaced Luck with backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. Late in the fourth quarter the Colts defense extended the lead, with an interception returned for a touchdown by Greg Toler. A Bortles pass to Cecil Shorts III was the last scoring play of the game, giving the Colts the 44-17 win. At the end of the game, Andrew Luck completed 31 of 39 pass attempts for 370 yards and four touchdown passes, which earned him the honor of AFC Offensive Player of the Week. The game marked the first win of the season for the Colts and improved their overall record to 1-2.",

After a scoreless first quarter, the Lions' Mikel Leshoure ran in three consecutive touchdowns, from 7, 1, and 8 yards out respectively to take a 21-point lead going into halftime. Leshoure became the first Lions rusher to score three touchdowns in the first half. After a scoreless third quarter, Detroit's Jason Hanson kicked a 42-yard field goal. The Jaguars finally got on the board when Micheal Spurlock caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Blaine Gabbert; they then completed a two-point conversion when Blaine Gabbert completed a pass to Rashad Jennings. The Lions responded with a 10-yard touchdown run from Joique Bell. Jacksonville scored the final points of the game with a 6-yard touchdown catch from Blaine Gabbert to Justin Blackmon; they again went for a two-point conversion, but were unsuccessful this time. It was the Lions' most lopsided win of the season and would also be their final victory of the 2012 season.",

Jacksonville scored the final points of the game with a 6-yard touchdown catch from Blaine Gabbert to Justin Blackmon; they again went for a two-point conversion, but were unsuccessful this time.

While the Chiefs got on the board first with Ryan Succop nailing a 45-yard goal, they fell behind when Rashad Jennings ran from the 28-yard line to the end zone for a touchdown. In the second quarter Ryan Succop made a 21-yard field goal, and then the Jaguars scored when David Garrard completed a 61-yard touchdown pass to Mike Sims-Walker. The only score in the third quarter was when Josh Scobee hit a 27-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter the Chiefs fell further behind when Maurice Jones-Drew got a 10-yard touchdown run. The Chiefs tried to come back with Matt Cassel completing a 54-yard and a 5-yard touchdown pass to Chris Chambers (Second time round the two-point conversion was made when Matt Cassel passed to Jamaal Charles) but couldn't go any further thanks to the Jaguars' defense resulting in a loss.",

The Seahawks immediately trailed on a scoring rally by the Raiders with kicker Sebastian Janikowski nailing a 31-yard field goal. This was followed in the second quarter by QB Jason Campbell's 30-yard TD pass to FB Marcel Reece. Then in the third quarter Janikowski made a 36-yard field goal. Then he made a 22-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to put the Raiders up 16-0. The Seahawks struggled further with Campbell getting a 69-yard TD pass to WR Darrius Heyward-Bey. The Seahawks would make their only score of the game with kicker Olindo Mare hitting a 47-yard field goal. However, they continued to trail as Janikowski made a 49-yard field goal, followed by RB Michael Bush making a 4-yard TD run.",

        "passage": " Still looking for their first win of the year, the Dolphins flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for a Week 6 intraconference duel with the Cleveland Browns.  With QB Trent Green still suffering from a concussion from last week, back-up QB Cleo Lemon was given the start. In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Browns RB Jason Wright got a 1-yard TD run.  The 'Fins would respond with kicker Jay Feely getting a 43-yard field goal.  However, Cleveland increased its lead with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Browns kicker Phil Dawson getting a 40-yard field goal, along with Anderson completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  The Dolphins answered with Lemon completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE David Martin, yet Cleveland managed to get a 20-yard field goal from Dawson as time ran out. In the third quarter, the 'Fins started to retaliate with Lemon getting a 5-yard and a 1-yard TD run.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Browns would pull away with Anderson and Edwards hooking up with each other on a 5-yard and a 16-yard TD pass.  Miami's only response would be Lemon's 4-yard TD pass to Martin. With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0-6 for the first time since 2004, but they also suffered their 9th-straight loss (the worst losing streak in franchise history). Along with the St. Louis Rams, it marked the first time since 2000 (Bengals and Chargers) that two teams began a season at 0-6.",

After Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 32-yard field goal in the first quarter, Baltimore got into the game with quarterback Joe Flacco hooking up with wide receiver Derrick Mason on a 20-yard touchdown pass.  In the second quarter, New England came back with quarterback Tom Brady's 1-yard touchdown run and running back Sammy Morris' 12-yard touchdown run. The Ravens would reply in the third quarter with defensive end Terrell Suggs sacking Brady, causing a fumble which rolled into the Patriots' endzone, where defensive end Dwan Edwards would land on it for a touchdown.  New England would come right back with Brady's 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Randy Moss.  Baltimore would play some catch-up in the fourth quarter as Flacco found running back Willis McGahee on a 13-yard touchdown pass, but the Patriots willingly replied with Gostkowski's 33-yard field goal.  Flacco would lead a last-minute drive, but New England's stiffened and came away with the win.",

        "passage": " Still looking for their first win of the season, the Bills went home, donned their throwback uniforms, and played a Week 4 AFC East duel with the New York Jets.  Buffalo would trail early in the first quarter as Jets running back LaDainian Tomlinson got a 1-yard touchdown run.  New York would add onto their lead in the second quarter as kicker Nick Folk nailed a 19-yard field goal, followed by quarterback Mark Sanchez completing a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Braylon Edwards.  Buffalo would close out the half as quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick connected with tight end David Martin on a 4-yard touchdown pass. In the third quarter, the Jets would greatly extend their lead with tight end Dustin Keller catching a 3-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver/quarterback Brad Smith, followed by his 2-yard touchdown reception from Sanchez.  Afterwards, Tomlinson would help secure the win for New York with his 26-yard touchdown run.  The Bills would close out the game in the fourth quarter as Fitzpatrick completed a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Steve Johnson. With the loss, Buffalo fell to 0-4. Two days later, Marshawn Lynch was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick in the 2011 draft and a conditional pick in the 2012 draft, and tackle Jamon Meredith was waived.",

Manuel, the game started off well for the Jets as Geno Smith ran in the end zone for a TD, and accounted for another on a long strike to Stephen Hill. The defense was stingy, holding off E.J. Manuel and the Bills offense throughout the game leading into the third quarter, and Nick Folk delivered two successful field goals to create a 20-6 cushion at the beginning of the 3rd quarter. However, it was to be acknowledged that the Jets committed a team-record 20 penalties for 168 yards, which helped the Bills get back into the game by the 4th quarter. Eventually, Geno Smith stepped up under pressure and delivered a game-winning, 69-yard TD to Santonio Holmes. As a result, the Jets proved that they can win in the face of adversity. Bilal Powell had a good day, rushing 27 times for 149 rushing yards.",

However, it was to be acknowledged that the Jets committed a team-record 20 penalties for 168 yards, which helped the Bills get back into the game by the 4th quarter. Eventually, Geno Smith stepped up under pressure and delivered a game-winning, 69-yard TD to Santonio Holmes. As a result, the Jets proved that they can win in the face of adversity.

        "passage": " Coming off their win over the Jaguars, the Broncos traveled to Lucas Oil Stadium for an AFC duel with the Indianapolis Colts. The Broncos grabbed the early lead in the first quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting with wide receiver Eric Decker on a 17-yard touchdown pass. The Colts responded, with a 27-yard field goal by placekicker Adam Vinatieri. Following a fumble by Broncos' return specialist Trindon Holliday on a punt return, the Colts grabbed the lead, with quarterback Andrew Luck completing an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey. The Broncos re-claimed the lead in the second quarter, with Manning throwing a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas. On the Broncos next possession, Colts' linebacker Robert Mathis forced a fumble off Manning out of the end zone, resulting in a safety. The Colts subsequently re-claimed the lead, with Luck connecting on a 20-yard touchdown pass to fullback Stanley Havili, then added to their lead, with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Luck to tight end Coby Fleener just before halftime. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their first three possessions of the third quarter, and the Colts took a 33-14 lead, with Luck rushing for a 10-yard touchdown. Late in the third quarter, the Broncos tried to cut into the Colts lead, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, but the Colts responded early in the fourth quarter, with a 52-yard field goal by Vinatieri. Trailing 36-17, the Broncos attempted a rally, with Manning connecting on a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Knowshon Moreno. The latter score occurred after Broncos' safety Duke Ihenacho forced a fumble off Colts' running back Trent Richardson deep in Colts' territory. The Broncos' defense forced a punt on the Colts next possession. However, with 7:07 remaining in the fourth quarter, Manning's arm was hit by Colts' linebacker Erik Walden, and his pass was subsequently intercepted by linebacker Pat Angerer deep in Broncos' territory. Four plays later, a Vinatieri 42-yard field goal gave the Colts a 39-30 lead with 6:06 remaining. Eight plays into the Broncos' next possession, running back Ronnie Hillman lost a fumble at the Colts' 3-yard line at the 3:15 mark of the fourth quarter, just as the Broncos were attempting to narrow the Colts' lead. The Colts' offense subsequently ran time off the clock, forcing the Broncos to burn all three of their team timeouts. The Broncos tried a desperation rally with 1:28 remaining, with Prater nailing a 47-yard field goal with only 17 seconds remaining. However, the ensuing onside kick was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Colts. With the loss, the Broncos' 17-game regular season winning streak was snapped. This marked Peyton Manning's first visit to Indianapolis since he was released by the Colts in March 2012. Manning was the Colts' starting quarterback from 1998-2010, before missing the entire 2011 season due to multiple neck surgeries.",

        "cleaned_passage": "Coming off their win over the Jaguars, the Broncos traveled to Lucas Oil Stadium for an AFC duel with the Indianapolis Colts. The Broncos grabbed the early lead in the first quarter, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting with wide receiver Eric Decker on a 17-yard touchdown pass. The Colts responded, with a 27-yard field goal by placekicker Adam Vinatieri. Following a fumble by Broncos' return specialist Trindon Holliday on a punt return, the Colts grabbed the lead, with quarterback Andrew Luck completing an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey. The Broncos re-claimed the lead in the second quarter, with Manning throwing a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Julius Thomas. On the Broncos next possession, Colts' linebacker Robert Mathis forced a fumble off Manning out of the end zone, resulting in a safety. The Colts subsequently re-claimed the lead, with Luck connecting on a 20-yard touchdown pass to fullback Stanley Havili, then added to their lead, with an 8-yard touchdown pass from Luck to tight end Coby Fleener just before halftime. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their first three possessions of the third quarter, and the Colts took a 33-14 lead, with Luck rushing for a 10-yard touchdown. Late in the third quarter, the Broncos tried to cut into the Colts lead, with a 31-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater, but the Colts responded early in the fourth quarter, with a 52-yard field goal by Vinatieri. Trailing 36-17, the Broncos attempted a rally, with Manning connecting on a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Knowshon Moreno. The latter score occurred after Broncos' safety Duke Ihenacho forced a fumble off Colts' running back Trent Richardson deep in Colts' territory. The Broncos' defense forced a punt on the Colts next possession. However, with 7:07 remaining in the fourth quarter, Manning's arm was hit by Colts' linebacker Erik Walden, and his pass was subsequently intercepted by linebacker Pat Angerer deep in Broncos' territory. Four plays later, a Vinatieri 42-yard field goal gave the Colts a 39-30 lead with 6:06 remaining. Eight plays into the Broncos' next possession, running back Ronnie Hillman lost a fumble at the Colts' 3-yard line at the 3:15 mark of the fourth quarter, just as the Broncos were attempting to narrow the Colts' lead. The Colts' offense subsequently ran time off the clock, forcing the Broncos to burn all three of their team timeouts. The Broncos tried a desperation rally with 1:28 remaining, with Prater nailing a 47-yard field goal with only 17 seconds remaining. However, the ensuing onside kick was unsuccessful, sealing the win for the Colts. With the loss, the Broncos' 17-game regular season winning streak was snapped. This marked Peyton Manning's first visit to Indianapolis since he was released by the Colts in March 2012. Manning was the Colts' starting quarterback from 1998-2010, before missing the entire 2011 season due to multiple neck surgeries.",

        "passage": " In week 2, the Seahawks took on their division rivals, the San Francisco 49ers. Prior to the season, NFL analysts rated this rivalry as the top upcoming rivalry, as well as the top rivalry of the decade. Both teams proved that point, when they had an arms race in the off-season, Seattle picking up Percy Harvin and San Francisco picking Anquan Boldin in the off-season, among others. Last season, the teams were 1-1 against each other, Seattle being the better team, as they blew out the Niners 42-13 in the last meeting in Seattle, coincidentally, also on Sunday Night Football. It was also a day that Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick appeared to bet an eyebrow, with the loser shaving his eyebrow; this was later revealed to be a publicity stunt. Finally, it was a day where former Seahawk Shaun Alexander would raise the 12th man flag. The game began quietly though, as both sides failed to establish a rhythm. The game was delayed midway through the first quarter due to lightning in the vicinity of the stadium, the second such case in the 2013 season (Ravens-Broncos kickoff game in week 1 was the first). After getting back onto the field, the 49ers blocked a Seahawks punt and got the ball in Seattle territory. However, Seattle claimed a whistle was heard from the crowd, which confused the linemen and the punter. That claim was later justified by NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth. The Niners took advantage and drove to the Seattle 10-yard line. However, on third down, Earl Thomas intercepted a Colin Kaepernick pass, and Seattle regained possession. A few plays later, Russell Wilson was intercepted by rookie Eric Reid, and the tug of war continued into the second quarter. All was quiet until midway through the second quarter, where fullback Bruce Miller was caught holding in the endzone, the result of which was a safety, and a Seattle 2-0 lead. Later on, defensive end Cliff Avril strip sacked Kaepernick and K. J. Wright recovered for Seattle, the result of which was a Steven Hauschka 30-yard field goal. Halftime came with a small 5-0 Seahawks lead. The game was pretty dark and messy at that point, the only bright side being Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch. In the third quarter, the Seahawks came out roaring. On third and 12, Wilson connected with receiver Doug Baldwin for a 51-yard gain to inside the 49ers 25 yard line. A few plays later, Lynch took it to the house on a 14-yard run, 12-0 Seattle. The 49ers responded with a drive to the Seattle 6-yard line, capped of by Phil Dawson 21-yard field goal, that included a 28-yard scramble by Kaepernick, 12-3 Seahawks. However, that would be it for the Niners, and the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Seahawks demolished the Niners on all phases of play. It started with Wilson hitting Lynch for a 7-yard score on third down. A few plays into the Niners next drive, Kaepernick was intercepted by Richard Sherman, who took it to the 49ers 25-yard line. That resulted in a 37-yard Steven Hauschka field goal. On the ensuing Niners drive, Kaepernick was intercepted again, this time by safety Kam Chancellor, who had signed a contract extension earlier in the year. Lynch scored on a 2-yard run on the next play. Seattle led 29-3. The 49ers fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Seattle recovered. Seattle won, in convincing style, silencing any critics. The 12th man also broke a Guinness world record, for the loudest outdoor stadium. Yet again, Seattle dominated on SNF, and Pete Carroll improved to 3-4 overall against the Niners, and 2-3 against bitter rival Jim Harbaugh. Seattle was now 2-0, and still unbeaten at home.",

        "cleaned_passage": "In week 2, the Seahawks took on their division rivals, the San Francisco 49ers. Prior to the season, NFL analysts rated this rivalry as the top upcoming rivalry, as well as the top rivalry of the decade. Both teams proved that point, when they had an arms race in the off-season, Seattle picking up Percy Harvin and San Francisco picking Anquan Boldin in the off-season, among others. Last season, the teams were 1-1 against each other, Seattle being the better team, as they blew out the Niners 42-13 in the last meeting in Seattle, coincidentally, also on Sunday Night Football. It was also a day that Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick appeared to bet an eyebrow, with the loser shaving his eyebrow; this was later revealed to be a publicity stunt. Finally, it was a day where former Seahawk Shaun Alexander would raise the 12th man flag. The game began quietly though, as both sides failed to establish a rhythm. The game was delayed midway through the first quarter due to lightning in the vicinity of the stadium, the second such case in the 2013 season (Ravens-Broncos kickoff game in week 1 was the first). After getting back onto the field, the 49ers blocked a Seahawks punt and got the ball in Seattle territory. However, Seattle claimed a whistle was heard from the crowd, which confused the linemen and the punter. That claim was later justified by NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth. The Niners took advantage and drove to the Seattle 10-yard line. However, on third down, Earl Thomas intercepted a Colin Kaepernick pass, and Seattle regained possession. A few plays later, Russell Wilson was intercepted by rookie Eric Reid, and the tug of war continued into the second quarter. All was quiet until midway through the second quarter, where fullback Bruce Miller was caught holding in the endzone, the result of which was a safety, and a Seattle 2-0 lead. Later on, defensive end Cliff Avril strip sacked Kaepernick and K. J. Wright recovered for Seattle, the result of which was a Steven Hauschka 30-yard field goal. Halftime came with a small 5-0 Seahawks lead. The game was pretty dark and messy at that point, the only bright side being Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch. In the third quarter, the Seahawks came out roaring. On third and 12, Wilson connected with receiver Doug Baldwin for a 51-yard gain to inside the 49ers 25 yard line. A few plays later, Lynch took it to the house on a 14-yard run, 12-0 Seattle. The 49ers responded with a drive to the Seattle 6-yard line, capped of by Phil Dawson 21-yard field goal, that included a 28-yard scramble by Kaepernick, 12-3 Seahawks. However, that would be it for the Niners, and the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Seahawks demolished the Niners on all phases of play. It started with Wilson hitting Lynch for a 7-yard score on third down. A few plays into the Niners next drive, Kaepernick was intercepted by Richard Sherman, who took it to the 49ers 25-yard line. That resulted in a 37-yard Steven Hauschka field goal. On the ensuing Niners drive, Kaepernick was intercepted again, this time by safety Kam Chancellor, who had signed a contract extension earlier in the year. Lynch scored on a 2-yard run on the next play. Seattle led 29-3. The 49ers fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Seattle recovered. Seattle won, in convincing style, silencing any critics. The 12th man also broke a Guinness world record, for the loudest outdoor stadium. Yet again, Seattle dominated on SNF, and Pete Carroll improved to 3-4 overall against the Niners, and 2-3 against bitter rival Jim Harbaugh. Seattle was now 2-0, and still unbeaten at home.",

New Orleans would deliver the opening punch in the first quarter as 49ers center David Baas' high snap deep within San Francisco territory went out of the back of the endzone for a safety.  The Saints would add onto their lead as quarterback Drew Brees hooked up with running back Reggie Bush on a 6-yard touchdown pass.  The 49ers would answer in the second quarter as quarterback Alex Smith found running back Frank Gore on a 12-yard touchdown pass. San Francisco would take the lead with running back Anthony Dixon's 2-yard touchdown run, yet New Orleans would respond with Brees' 3-yard touchdown pass to tight end David Thomas.  The Saints would add onto their lead in the fourth quarter as kicker Garrett Hartley made a 46-yard and a 19-yard field goal.  The 49ers would strike back as Gore got a 7-yard touchdown run, followed by Smith's 2-point conversion pass to tight end Vernon Davis.  In the end, New Orleans got the last laugh as Hartley booted the game-ending 37-yard field goal.",

        "passage": " Coming off their Monday Night win over the Raiders, the Broncos remained on home ground for an interconference duel with the Philadelphia Eagles. A 6-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Wes Welker gave the Broncos the early lead. The Eagles countered, with a 35-yard field goal by placekicker Alex Henery, however, the Broncos subsequently increased their lead, with return specialist Trindon Holliday returning the ensuing kickoff 105 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles cut into the Broncos' lead in the second quarter, with a 25-yard field goal by Henery, followed by running back Chris Polk rushing for a 4-yard touchdown to pull to within 14-13. However, the Broncos proceeded to score 38 unanswered points and take control of the game. First, running back Knowshon Moreno rushed for a 4-yard touchdown. Then in the third quarter, Manning added three more touchdown passes &#8212; a 1-yarder and a 15-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, followed by a 4-yarder to Welker. In the fourth quarter, Broncos' linebacker Steven Johnson blocked Donnie Jones' punt and immediately returned the football 17 yards for a touchdown, which was followed by a 53-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. The Eagles scored a late touchdown, with quarterback Nick Foles, playing in place of Michael Vick, completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeff Maehl, but the outcome of the game had already been decided in the Broncos' favor. Former offensive lineman Tom Nalen, who played with the Broncos from 1994-2007, was inducted to the Broncos Ring of Fame during halftime. Nalen made it to five Pro Bowls, earning the NFL's Offensive Lineman of the Year award in 2003, and was an integral part of 11 seasons in which the Broncos had at least one running back rush for 1,000 yards within a season. Steven Johnson's return of a blocked punt for a touchdown marked the first such play for the Broncos' special teams since 2000. Four years later, the Eagles got revenge on the Broncos by beating Denver 51-23.",

A 6-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Wes Welker gave the Broncos the early lead. The Eagles countered, with a 35-yard field goal by placekicker Alex Henery, however, the Broncos subsequently increased their lead, with return specialist Trindon Holliday returning the ensuing kickoff 105 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles cut into the Broncos' lead in the second quarter, with a 25-yard field goal by Henery, followed by running back Chris Polk rushing for a 4-yard touchdown to pull to within 14-13. However, the Broncos proceeded to score 38 unanswered points and take control of the game. First, running back Knowshon Moreno rushed for a 4-yard touchdown. Then in the third quarter, Manning added three more touchdown passes &#8212; a 1-yarder and a 15-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, followed by a 4-yarder to Welker. In the fourth quarter, Broncos' linebacker Steven Johnson blocked Donnie Jones' punt and immediately returned the football 17 yards for a touchdown, which was followed by a 53-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. The Eagles scored a late touchdown, with quarterback Nick Foles, playing in place of Michael Vick, completing a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jeff Maehl, but the outcome of the game had already been decided in the Broncos' favor. Former offensive lineman Tom Nalen, who played with the Broncos from 1994-2007, was inducted to the Broncos Ring of Fame during halftime. Nalen made it to five Pro Bowls, earning the NFL's Offensive Lineman of the Year award in 2003, and was an integral part of 11 seasons in which the Broncos had at least one running back rush for 1,000 yards within a season. Steven Johnson's return of a blocked punt for a touchdown marked the first such play for the Broncos' special teams since 2000. Four years later, the Eagles got revenge on the Broncos by beating Denver 51-23.",

Trent Green was still recovering from his concussion, and Arizona's rookie quarterback Matt Leinart made his career start.  The game was broadcast on CBS 1:15pm Arizona time. The game began with Arizona's offense dominating and catching the Chiefs' defense off-guard with a 49-yard touchdown pass to Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, putting the Cardinals on the scoreboard within three minutes of the game. On the opening kickoff, Dante Hall was injured and left the game,  leaving rookie Jeff Webb to return the kicks for the rest of the game, including a 56-yard punt return.  Samie Parker caught a 15-yard touchdown pass, leaving the Chiefs within three points of the Cardinals (17-20).  The play was officially reviewed as the referees initially thought Parker caught the ball out of bounds, but the referees decided it was caught in the endzone. Damon Huard threw Larry Johnson a 78-yard screen pass that would be stopped short of a touchdown when Antrel Rolle twisted Johnson's neck by grabbing his facemask, sending him to the turf motionless for 2&#160;minutes.  Johnson recovered and received a standing ovation.  The NFL fined Rolle $12,500 for his penalty.  It was the second time in the 2006 season in which Rolle had been fined for an illegal tackle.  The play set up Lawrence Tynes' eventual game-winning field goal, leaving the Chiefs with the 23-20 lead.

In the first quarter, Tennessee drew first blood as QB Vince Young completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Roydell Williams for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Chiefs tied the game with QB Brodie Croyle completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Samie Parker. Afterwards, the Titans responded with kicker Rob Bironas managing to get a 37-yard field goal. Kansas City would take the lead prior to halftime with Croyle completing a 9-yard TD pass to FB Kris Wilson. In the third quarter, Tennessee would draw close as Bironas kicked a 37-yard field goal. The Chiefs answered with kicker John Carney getting a 36-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Titans would retake the lead with Young and Williams hooking up with each other again on a 41-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, Tennessee clinched the victory with Bironas nailing a 40-yard and a 25-yard field goal. With the win, the Titans kept their playoff hopes alive at 8-6.",

In the first quarter the Bengals trailed early as QB Matt Ryan made a 3-yard TD pass to WR Brian Finneran. But they replied with kicker Mike Nugent making a 20-yard field goal. The Bengals struggled in the second quarter with kicker Matt Bryant hitting a 45-yard field goal. Then Ryan found WR Roddy White on a 43-yard TD pass, followed by RB Michael Turner getting a 2-yard TD run. The Bengals took control in the third quarter with Nugent nailing a 33-yard field goal, followed by QB Carson Palmer completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens. Then Palmer found WR Jordan Shipley on a 64-yard TD pass. Then DB Adam Jones returned a fumble 59 yards to the endzone for a touchdown (With a failed two-point conversion). The Falcons pulled away in the fourth quarter with Ryan making an 11-yard TD pass to White. (With the 2-point conversion successful as Ryan passed to White) This was followed by Turner getting a 3-yard TD run. The Bengals tried to tie the game, but only came away with one touchdown after Palmer found WR Chad Ochocinco on an 8-yard TD pass.",

He put up a 43-yarder in the first, along with a 25 and a 21-yarder in the second quarter.  In the third quarter, the Browns offense finally got going as Cleveland quarterback Charlie Frye hooked up with TE Kellen Winslow on an 18-yard touchdown pass.  Fortunately, the Saints would respond with a 12-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Drew Brees to WR Marques Colston.  In the fourth quarter, the Browns came close with Frye getting a 1-yard touchdown run.  However, the Saints put the game away with Carney kicking a 20-yard FG to give the Saints the win. Despite not scoring a touchdown, RB Reggie Bush had a sound NFL debut, as he ran 14 times for 61 yards, caught 8 passes for 58 yards, and returned three punts for 22 Yards.  In total, he piled up 141 all-purpose yards.",

Buccaneers running back Earnest Graham was a part of the starting lineup for the first time in his career, replacing the injured Michael Pittman, who sat out the game. The first half was a defensive struggle, with neither team scoring in the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Tennessee drove to the Buccaneers 32-yard line, but quarterback Vince Young fumbled the ball and the Buccaneers recovered. Jeff Garcia connected on a 39-yard pass play to Michael Clayton, to help set up a 23-yard Matt Bryant field goal, the first points of the game. Moments later, Phillip Buchanon intercepted Vince Young with 1:29 remaining in the half, to maintain a 3-0 halftime lead. Tennessee took the second half kickoff, and executed a 12-play, 45-yard drive which resulted in a 48-yard field goal by Rob Bironas. On their next possession, Vince Young ran out of bounds, and suffered a strained quad. He would have to leave the game, and was replaced by Kerry Collins. On Tampa Bay's next drive, Garcia connected with Joey Galloway for a 69-yard touchdown catch. On the ensuing drive Ronde Barber intercepted a pass by Kerry Collins, but it ruled incomplete after review. With less than four minutes remaining in regulation, Collins drove the Titans to the Buccaneers 23-yard line. For the second time, Ronde Barber intercepted Collins, this time in the endzone, but it was again ruled incomplete after review. The drive continued, and with 1:24 remaining, LenDale White tied the game 10-10 with a touchdown run. With only one timeout, Garcia drove the Buccaneers 55 yards on seven plays. With 11 seconds remaining, Matt Bryant kicked a game-winning 43-yard field goal.",

        "passage": " Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Patriots, the Rams went home for a Week 9 NFC West duel with the Arizona Cardinals. In the first quarter, St. Louis struck first as QB Marc Bulger completed an 80-yard TD pass to WR Derek Stanley. In the second quarter, the Cardinals responded with a vengeance as safety Antrel Rolle returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown, kicker Neil Rackers got a 36-yard field goal, RB Tim Hightower got a 30-yard TD run, and former Rams QB Kurt Warner completed a 56-yard TD pass to WR Jerheme Urban. In the third quarter, Arizona increased its lead as Warner completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR Anquan Boldin. In the fourth quarter, the Rams tried to come back as Bulger completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt (with a failed 2-point conversion). However, the Cardinals flew away as Rackers nailed a 30-yard field goal. During the game, the Rams inducted former Head Coach Dick Vermeil (who helped the franchise win Super Bowl XXXIV) onto the Rams Ring of Honor.",

        "passage": " Hoping to rebound from their fourth-quarter collapse to the Panthers, the Vikings flew to Soldier Field to face Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears in a Week 16 rematch to conclude the 40th season of Monday Night Football. Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20-17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes started to rally with running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run (with the extra point attempt blocked). The Bears increased their lead over the Vikings with Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark. The Vikings then closed out the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre firing a 6-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. An exciting fourth quarter ensued. The Vikings started out the quarter's scoring with kicker Ryan Longwell's 41-yard field goal, along with Adrian Peterson's second 1-yard TD run. The Bears then responded with Cutler firing a 20-yard TD pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett. The Vikings then completed the remarkable comeback with Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 6-yard TD pass on 4th-and-goal with 15 seconds left in regulation. The Bears then took a knee to force overtime. In overtime, the Bears won the toss and marched down the field, stopping at the 35-yard line. However, the potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt by Gould went wide right, giving the Vikings a chance to win. After an exchange of punts, the Vikings had the ball at the 26-yard line with 11 minutes left in the period. On the first play of scrimmage, Favre fired a screen pass to Peterson who caught it and went 16 yards, before being confronted by Hunter Hillenmeyer, who caused Peterson to fumble the ball, which was then recovered by Bears' linebacker Nick Roach. The Bears then won on Jay Cutler's game-winning 39-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Aromashodu. With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 11-4, they also surrendered homefield advantage to the Saints.",

In the first quarter, Cleveland trailed early as Patriots kicker Adam Vinateri got a 20-yard field goal, while QB Tom Brady completed a 34-yard TD pass to WR Dont&#233; Stallworth. In the second quarter, the Browns continued to struggle as Gostkowski gave New England a 25-yard field goal, while Brady completed a 7-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson. In the third quarter, Cleveland tried to come back with kicker Phil Dawson getting a 42-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Browns drew closer with QB Derek Anderson completing a 21-yard TD pass to WR Tim Carter. However, the Patriots responded with Brady and Watson hooking up with each other on a 25-yard TD pass. The Browns tried to catch up with Anderson completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE Kellen Winslow. New England sealed its win with CB Randall Gay returning a fumble 19&#160;yards for a touchdown.",

In the first quarter, Carolina pounced first with kicker John Kasay getting a 33-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Panthers increased its lead with Kasay kicking a 43-yard field goal. The Cardinals would get on the board with RB Edgerrin James getting a 23-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Carolina responded with Kasay getting a 24-yard field goal, yet Arizona answered with kicker Neil Rackers getting a 50-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Testaverde completed a 65-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith, increasing his consecutive seasons with a touchdown pass record to 21-straight. Afterwards, the Panthers sealed the win with Kasay nailing a 45-yard field goal, while RB DeAngelo Williams got a 13-yard TD run. With the win, not only did Carolina improve to 4-2 heading into the bye week, but Testaverde became the oldest starting quarterback to win a game (43 years and 335 days), along with the third oldest quarterback to start a game.",

        "passage": " Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Bills, the Chargers flew to Wembley Stadium for the 2008 International Series game with the New Orleans Saints. In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as kicker Taylor Mehlhaff got a 23-yard field goal.  The 'Bolts would respond with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 33-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New Orleans regained the lead as QB Drew Brees (a former Charger) completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson (with a failed PAT) and RB Deuce McAllister getting a 1-yard TD run.  San Diego answered as QB Philip Rivers completed a 12-yard TD pass to RB LaDainian Tomlinson, but the Saints replied with Brees completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Lance Moore.  The Chargers closed out the half with Rivers completing a 12-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates. In the third quarter, New Orleans increased its lead Brees completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Mark Campbell, after a very controversial Pass interference call on cornerback Cletis Gordon put the Saints on the 1-yard line.  The 'Bolts would answer with Kaeding getting a 24-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Saints continued to build its lead as FB Mike Karney got a 1-yard TD run.  San Diego tried to rally as Kaeding nailed a 31-yard field goal, Rivers completed a 14-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson, and Brees giving the 'Bolts a safety via an incomplete pass thrown into the back of his own endzone.  However, New Orleans' defense stiffened for the win. With the loss, the Chargers went into their bye week at 3-5.",

        "cleaned_passage": "Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Bills, the Chargers flew to Wembley Stadium for the 2008 International Series game with the New Orleans Saints. In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as kicker Taylor Mehlhaff got a 23-yard field goal. The 'Bolts would respond with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 33-yard field goal. In the second quarter, New Orleans regained the lead as QB Drew Brees (a former Charger) completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson (with a failed PAT) and RB Deuce McAllister getting a 1-yard TD run. San Diego answered as QB Philip Rivers completed a 12-yard TD pass to RB LaDainian Tomlinson, but the Saints replied with Brees completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Lance Moore. The Chargers closed out the half with Rivers completing a 12-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates.

New York trailed in the first quarter as Browns kicker Phil Dawson made a 34-yard field goal. The Jets answered with a 27-yard field goal from kicker Nick Folk, but Cleveland responded with running back Peyton Hillis getting a 12-yard touchdown run. New York tied the game in the second quarter with quarterback Mark Sanchez finding wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery on a 25-yard touchdown pass. The Browns regained the lead with Dawson's 23-yard field goal, yet the Jets took the lead with Sanchez's 1-yard touchdown run. After a scoreless third quarter, New York added onto their lead in the fourth quarter with Folk's 25-yard field goal. However, Cleveland tied the game with quarterback Colt McCoy completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mohamed Massaquoi. In overtime, Sanchez found wide receiver Santonio Holmes on the game-ending 37-yard touchdown pass. The Jets became the first team in league history to win back-to-back overtime games on the road.",

In the 1st quarter Buffalo trailed early as kicker Josh Scobee made a 29-yard field goal. Then the Bills came on top with kicker Rian Lindell hitting a 26 and a 28-yard field goal. The Bills fell behind in the 2nd quarter when RB Maurice Jones-Drew got a 3-yard touchdown run. Then the Bills would score to end the half with Lindell nailing a 22-yard field goal. In the third quarter Buffalo took the lead with QB Ryan Fitzpatrick making a 98-yard touchdown pass to WR Terrell Owens (with a failed 2-point conversion attempt). In the fourth quarter Buffalo fell behind again with QB David Garrard making a 3-yard touchdown pass to WR Mike Sims-Walker (With a successful QB sneak to make the two-point conversion). With the loss, the Bills fell to 3-7 in Perry Fewell's first game as interim head coach.",

In the first quarter, the Niners struck first as kicker Joe Nedney got a 23-yard and a 22-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Cowboys took the lead as QB Tony Romo completed a 75-yard TD pass to former 49ers WR Terrell Owens.  Dallas continued its domination as LB Carlos Polk blocked punter Andy Lee's punt into the back of the endzone for a safety.  The Cowboys closed out its period of power as kicker Nick Folk got a 48-yard and a 41-yard field goal, along with Romo completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Martellus Bennett. In the third quarter, Dallas increased its lead with Romo completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  San Francisco tried to rally as Nedney got a 35-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys answered with Folk getting a 47-yard field goal.  The 49ers tried to come back as QB Shaun Hill completed an 18-yard TD pass to WR Isaac Bruce, but Dallas replied with Folk nailing a 42-yard field goal.  The Niners tried to rally as Hill completed a 9-yard TD pass to RB DeShaun Foster, but that would be as close as San Francisco's comeback would get.",

        "passage": " Looking to avoid back-to-back divisional losses, the Patriots traveled to Miami to face the 6-4 Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium. After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their \"Wildcat\" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the \"Wildcat\" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4. The Patriots' 530 net yards of offense were the second highest output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979. Cassel's 415 passing yards made him the second quarterback in Patriots history to throw for at least 400 yards in two or more games; Drew Bledsoe had four 400+ yard passing games in his Patriots career.",

        "cleaned_passage": "Looking to avoid back-to-back divisional losses, the Patriots traveled to Miami to face the 6-4 Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium. After Carpenter's kickoff was returned from the 29-yard line by Matthew Slater, the Patriots began their first possession at their own 40-yard line. Cassel's first two passes were both completed for first downs, putting the Patriots in Dolphins territory and eventually their red zone. However, a holding penalty on Neal pushed the Patriots back 10 yards, forcing a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal four plays later that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. Following a Dolphins three-and-out, the Patriots' second drive ended when a Cassel pass to Moss was bobbled by both Moss and cornerback Jason Allen to keep the ball in the air until Renaldo Hill intercepted it; a 17-yard return gave the Dolphins the ball at the Patriots' 42-yard line. On the next play, a 29-yard David Martin reception moved the Dolphins into the Patriots' red zone, where the Dolphins used their \"Wildcat\" formation on the next two plays. A Tedy Bruschi unnecessary roughness penalty on the second Ronnie Brown run set up a first-and-goal, where Camarillo caught a 3-yard pass from Pennington for a touchdown, giving the Dolphins a 7-3 lead. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 74-yard drive that ended on the first play of the second quarter, an 8-yard touchdown scramble by Cassel to give the Patriots the lead again, 10-7. The Dolphins' next drive went three-and-out despite two more plays using the \"Wildcat\" formation, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 41-yard line. On a 1-yard Morris run from the Dolphins' 28-yard line, linebacker Matt Roth forced a fumble during the tackle; the ball was recovered by Dolphins cornerback Andr&#233; Goodman at the Dolphins' 28-yard line. The Dolphins took advantage of the turnover, going 72 yards on 12 plays and re-taking the lead at 14-10 on a 7-yard Pennington touchdown scramble. Carpenter's ensuing kickoff was returned by Slater from the Patriots' 24-yard line, setting up the Patriots' next drive to begin from their own 37-yard line. Six plays later, Cassel completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Moss that gave the Patriots the lead again, 17-14. After an exchange of three-and-outs, the Dolphins began their final drive of the half with 39 seconds remaining and moved into Patriots territory. However, a false start on wide receiver Ted Ginn, Jr. followed by a Vrabel sack of Pennington ended the first half. Due to their deferral of the opening kickoff, the Dolphins elected to receive the opening kickoff of the second half. A 46-yard Pennington pass to Ginn on the first play moved the Dolphins to the Patriots' 36-yard line; six plays later, Pennington hit fullback Casey Cramer on a 2-yard touchdown catch that gave the Dolphins the lead again at 21-17. The Patriots responded by going 78 yards on 11 plays, re-taking the lead yet again on the second Moss touchdown catch of the day; the 8-yard grab put the Patriots ahead 24-21. The Dolphins' next drive got as far as the Patriots' 27-yard line, but an offensive holding penalty, incomplete pass, and sack forced the Dolphins to punt from the Patriots' 42-yard line. Two plays later, Cassel completed a pass to Welker across the middle; the wide receiver ran along the sideline after the catch to pick up 64 yards on the play. After an incomplete pass to Moss, a 21-yard Faulk touchdown run extended the Patriots' lead to 31-21 on the final play of the third quarter. Four plays into the Dolphins' ensuing drive, on 3rd-and-3, Pennington hit wide receiver Davone Bess for a 36-yard gain to put the Dolphins in the Patriots' red zone. On the next play, a diving Ricky Williams 13-yard touchdown catch cut the Patriots' lead to 31-28. Facing a 3rd-and-10 from their own 42-yard line during their next drive, the Patriots moved into Dolphins territory on a 23-yard Gaffney catch. Two plays later, Cassel and Moss connected for their third touchdown pass of the day, this one from 29 yards out, to give the Patriots a 38-28 lead. On the next play, Meriweather intercepted a Pennington pass and returned it 19 yards to the Dolphins' 18-yard line. However, safety Yeremiah Bell sacked Cassel on 3rd-and-2 to set up a 30-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 41-28 with just over seven minutes remaining in the game. Starting from their own 1-yard after a Ginn kick return for a loss and a holding penalty, the Dolphins moved the ball as far as their 44-yard line on 10 plays, but could not successfully convert on fourth down to turn the ball back over to the Patriots. The Patriots, with just four minutes remaining in the game, exclusively ran Green-Ellis running plays on their ensuing possession, moving into the Dolphins' red zone on back-to-back unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by Porter. On the six play of the drive, a fourth down, Green-Ellis ran for a 1-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 48-28 lead. Down by 20 points, the Dolphins ran one play in the remaining 37 seconds to end the game and improve the Patriots' record to 7-4. The Patriots' 530 net yards of offense were the second highest output in team history, behind the Patriots' 597 yards in 1979. Cassel's 415 passing yards made him the second quarterback in Patriots history to throw for at least 400 yards in two or more games; Drew Bledsoe had four 400+ yard passing games in his Patriots career.",

        "passage": " Following their Monday Night debacle in San Diego and subsequent videotaping scandal, the Broncos returned home for an interconference match against the St. Louis Rams. In the first quarter, the Broncos jumped out to a 10-0 lead, with a 4-yard touchdown run from running back Knowshon Moreno, followed by a 49-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. The Rams responded, with quarterback Sam Bradford throwing a 36-yard touchdown pass to tight end Michael Hoomanawanui. In the second quarter, The Broncos took a 13-7 lead, with a 40-yard field goal by Prater. However, the Rams would reel off 26 unanswered points, starting off with a pair of touchdown passes from Bradford to tight end Billy Bajema&#8212;2 and 26 yards&#8212;the latter with a missed extra point, followed by a pair of field goals from placekicker Josh Brown&#8212;28 and 37 yards&#8212;before halftime. In the third quarter, the Rams continued their offensive onslaught, with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Kenneth Darby, giving St. Louis a 33-13 lead. In the fourth quarter, the Broncos snapped the Rams' streak of 26 unanswered points, with quarterback Kyle Orton throwing a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Lloyd, but the Rams responded with a 26-yard field goal from Brown. Trailing 36-20 with four minutes remaining, the Broncos tried to rally, with Orton throwing two touchdown passes&#8212;a 16-yarder to wide receiver Eddie Royal (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 5-yarder to Lloyd, but the Broncos' rally attempt was cut short by the Rams' defense. With the loss, the Broncos matched their loss total from the previous two seasons.",

In the first quarter, the Broncos jumped out to a 10-0 lead, with a 4-yard touchdown run from running back Knowshon Moreno, followed by a 49-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. The Rams responded, with quarterback Sam Bradford throwing a 36-yard touchdown pass to tight end Michael Hoomanawanui. In the second quarter, The Broncos took a 13-7 lead, with a 40-yard field goal by Prater. However, the Rams would reel off 26 unanswered points, starting off with a pair of touchdown passes from Bradford to tight end Billy Bajema&#8212;2 and 26 yards&#8212;the latter with a missed extra point, followed by a pair of field goals from placekicker Josh Brown&#8212;28 and 37 yards&#8212;before halftime. In the third quarter, the Rams continued their offensive onslaught, with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Kenneth Darby, giving St. Louis a 33-13 lead. In the fourth quarter, the Broncos snapped the Rams' streak of 26 unanswered points, with quarterback Kyle Orton throwing a 41-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Lloyd, but the Rams responded with a 26-yard field goal from Brown. Trailing 36-20 with four minutes remaining, the Broncos tried to rally, with Orton throwing two touchdown passes&#8212;a 16-yarder to wide receiver Eddie Royal (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), followed by a 5-yarder to Lloyd, but the Broncos' rally attempt was cut short by the Rams' defense. With the loss, the Broncos matched their loss total from the previous two seasons.",
