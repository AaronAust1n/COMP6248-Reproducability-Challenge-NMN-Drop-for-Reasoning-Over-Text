Atlanta would take flight in the first quarter as quarterback Matt Ryan completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Tony Gonzalez, followed by cornerback Tye Hill returning an interception 62 yards for a touchdown.  The Redskins would answer in the second quarter as kicker Shaun Suisham nailed a 48-yard field goal, yet the Falcons kept their attack on as running back Michael Turner got a 30-yard touchdown run, followed by kicker Jason Elam booting a 33-yard field goal. Washington began to rally in the third quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back Ladell Betts.  The Redskins would come closer in the fourth quarter as quarterback Jason Campbell hooked up with tight end Todd Yoder on a 3-yard touchdown pass, yet Atlanta closed out the game with Turner's 58-yard touchdown run.",

In the first quarter, Buffalo got off to a fast start as rookie QB Trent Edwards completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Michael Gaines and a 4-yard TD pass to WR Lee Evans.  In the second quarter, the Giants took the lead with RB Brandon Jacobs getting a 6-yard and a 43-yard TD run, along with kicker Lawrence Tynes getting a 42-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bills regained the lead with rookie RB Marshawn Lynch getting a 3-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  However, in the fourth quarter, New York pulled away as LB Kawika Mitchell returning an interception 30 yards for a touchdown, RB Ahmad Bradshaw getting an 88-yard TD run, and CB Corey Webster returning an interception 34 yards for a touchdown.",

In the first quarter, New York scored first as QB Eli Manning completed a 40-yard TD pass to WR Amani Toomer, along with kicker John Carney getting a 31-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead as Carney got a 38-yard field goal.  The Redskins would close out the half with WR Devin Thomas getting a 29-yard TD run. In the third quarter, New York began to pull away as RB Brandon Jacobs got a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants sealed the deal with Carney connecting on a 39-yard field goal. With the season-sweep, the Giants improved to 11-1, exceeding the 1986 and 1990 teams (both started 10-2 and eventually won the Super Bowl) for the best 12-game record in franchise history.",

        "passage": " Trying to rebound from their home loss to the Texans, the Panther flew to the Georgia Dome for an NFC South duel with the Atlanta Falcons. After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina scored first in the second quarter with kicker John Kasay hitting a 45-yard field goal. The Falcons took the lead with QB Joey Harrington completing a 69-yard TD pass to WR Roddy White. The Panthers followed up with QB Jake Delhomme completing a 13-yard TD pass to RB DeShaun Foster. Atlanta would end the half with kicker Morten Andersen hitting a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Falcons took the lead as Harrington completed a 13-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler. Carolina retook the lead with Delhomme completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King, followed by a 10-yard TD run from Foster. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers scored again, with Kasay kicking a 49-yard field goal. The Falcons' Andersen nailed a 25-yard field goal to end the scoring. The game was noteworthy because of DeAngelo Hall's third quarter meltdown, wherein he was assessed 67 yards of penalties in a single drive. The penalties included a 37-yard pass interference penalty for tackling WR Steve Smith before the ball arrived, a 15-yard personal foul on the following play for blocking Smith at the line, and a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty during a verbal exchange with Smith following a third-down sack by John Abraham. The unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave Carolina a first down, allowing their eventual TD to King rather than the likely 45-yard field goal attempt had the penalty not been called. Following the series, Hall was seen arguing with coaches on the sidelines, leading to a $100,000 fine by the team.",

Atlanta would end the half with kicker Morten Andersen hitting a 24-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Falcons took the lead as Harrington completed a 13-yard TD pass to TE Alge Crumpler. Carolina retook the lead with Delhomme completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Jeff King, followed by a 10-yard TD run from Foster. In the fourth quarter, the Panthers scored again, with Kasay kicking a 49-yard field goal. The Falcons' Andersen nailed a 25-yard field goal to end the scoring. The game was noteworthy because of DeAngelo Hall's third quarter meltdown, wherein he was assessed 67 yards of penalties in a single drive. The penalties included a 37-yard pass interference penalty for tackling WR Steve Smith before the ball arrived, a 15-yard personal foul on the following play for blocking Smith at the line, and a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty during a verbal exchange with Smith following a third-down sack by John Abraham. The unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave Carolina a first down, allowing their eventual TD to King rather than the likely 45-yard field goal attempt had the penalty not been called. Following the series, Hall was seen arguing with coaches on the sidelines, leading to a $100,000 fine by the team.",

In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee managed to get a 48-yard field goal, along with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Chargers got on the board with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 23-yard field goal.  However, Jacksonville responded with QB David Garrard completing a 36-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Williams. In the third quarter, San Diego responded with RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 6-yard TD run, yet the Jaguars answered with Garrard completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Marcedes Lewis.  In the fourth quarter, the Chargers tried to make a comeback as QB Philip Rivers completed a 24-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates.  But it was too-little too-late, as Jacksonville's defense held on to win.",

'04) for an NFC South match-up on Monday Night.  From the get-go the Falcons trailed, when they had a punt blocked by Saints safety Steve Gleason and DB Curtis Deloatch landed on the ball in the end zone for the touchdown.  The Falcons would respond, as kicker Morten Andersen (who used to play for the Saints) kicked a 26-yard field goal.  That would be their only score of the night, as WR Devery Henderson ran for an 11-yard TD on a reverse.  Then, Saints kicker John Carney would provide the remaining points for the New Orleans, as he kicked two field goals in the second quarter (a 37-yarder and a 51-yarder) and one field goal in the third (a 20-yarder).  The Falcons would fall to 2-1, as their offense got swapped, battered, and bruised.  QB Michael Vick got sacked five times, while he and RB Warrick Dunn would only combine for 101 rushing yards.",

The Texans got on the scoreboard after kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard field goal, but fell further behind after kkicker Rob Bironas hit a 30-yard field goal. The Texans tried to cut the lead with QB Matt Schaub getting a 12-yard TD pass to WR Andre Johnson, but the Titans would pull away with RB Javon Ringer getting a 7-yard TD run. The Texans tried to come back into the game, but only came away with Schaub throwing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter. With the loss, the Texans fell to 5-9, and were officially eliminated from postseason contention.",

Both defenses dominated the first quarter, and in the second quarter, Baltimore forced three turnovers (two interceptions and a fumble) from Donovan McNabb.  Ravens kicker Matt Stover booted a 44-yard field goal, while quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Daniel Wilcox.  However, rookie  Quintin Demps returned the following kickoff 100 yards for a Philadelphia touchdown to make it 10-7 Ravens at halftime.  Andy Reid decided to bench McNabb (who was 8-for-18 for 59 yards and two interceptions) and put backup quarterback Kevin Kolb into the game.  Kolb also struggled with the Baltimore defense, and the Eagles fell behind 12-7 when linebacker Jameel McClain blocked Sav Rocca's punt into the back of the endzone for a safety. In the fourth, the Ravens kicked another field goal after a Kolb interception, then Mark Clayton took a short slant 53-yards for a touchdown to make it 22-7.  Kolb drove Philadelphia to the Raven 1-yard line, but was intercepted in the end zone by Ed Reed, who returned the ball an NFL-record 108 yards for the touchdown.  Le'Ron McClain added a 1-yard touchdown run as Baltimore won 36-7.  Kolb was 10-for-23 for 73 yards and two interceptions, and Brian Westbrook had 39 yards rushing on 14 carries.  The Eagles dropped to 5-5-1.",

        "passage": " Things got off to a quick start for the Seahawks as rookie Josh Wilson returned the opening kickoff 72 yards to the Bengal 24-yard line. Three plays later, Matt Hasselbeck hit WR Bobby Engram for an 18-yard TD and a 7-0 Seahawks lead. The Bengals were quick to respond, as Bengal QB Carson Palmer hit 6 of his first 7 pass attempts for 90 yards, culminating with an 18-yard touchdown pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh and evening the score at 7-7. After turnovers by each team, Cincinnati K Shayne Graham converted a 43-yard field goal attempt to give the Bengals a 10-7 lead 80 seconds into the second quarter. With 3:06 left in the first half, Seahawk defensive lineman Chartric Darby's   heavy pressure on Palmer led to a Deon Grant interception at the Seattle 31-yard line. A few plays later, Hasselbeck hit Deion Branch with a 42-yard touchdown pass and a 14-10 Seahawk lead at halftime. 3:51 into the third quarter, Cincinnati linebacker Lemar Marshall sacked Hasselbeck in the endzone for a safety, cutting the lead to 14-12. Neither team scored again until there was 9:57 left in the game when Graham booted a 24-yard field goal to give Cincinnati its first lead of the second half at 15-14. On the next possession, Hasselbeck moved the Seahawks to the opposition's 6-yard line. WR Nate Burleson was unable to hold on to a pass in the endzone, and the Seahawks settled for a K Josh Brown field goal, reclaiming the lead at 17-15. Palmer then connected with Chad Johnson on two big pass plays late in the fourth quarter, followed by 2 runs by back-up RB Kenny Watson for a Bengal TD. Cincinnati opted to try a 2-point conversion, but CB Jordan Babineaux stopped Watson after a pitch from Palmer. The Bengals led 21-17 when the Seahawks got the ball with 2:42 left in the game. The Seahawks sputtered near mid-field, and faced 4th and 1. RB Shaun Alexander broke through for 22 yards, and Hasselbeck hit Nate Burleson with a 22-yard TD pass on the next play for a 24-21 lead with 1:00 left. Seahawks linebacker Lance Laury forced a fumble during the ensuing kickoff, with FS Deon Grant recovering for Seattle. Two plays later Alexander ran for a first down (and 100 yards on the game), cementing the Seahawk victory and improving their record to 2-1.",

Three plays later, Matt Hasselbeck hit WR Bobby Engram for an 18-yard TD and a 7-0 Seahawks lead. The Bengals were quick to respond, as Bengal QB Carson Palmer hit 6 of his first 7 pass attempts for 90 yards, culminating with an 18-yard touchdown pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh and evening the score at 7-7. After turnovers by each team, Cincinnati K Shayne Graham converted a 43-yard field goal attempt to give the Bengals a 10-7 lead 80 seconds into the second quarter. With 3:06 left in the first half, Seahawk defensive lineman Chartric Darby's heavy pressure on Palmer led to a Deon Grant interception at the Seattle 31-yard line. A few plays later, Hasselbeck hit Deion Branch with a 42-yard touchdown pass and a 14-10 Seahawk lead at halftime. 3:51 into the third quarter, Cincinnati linebacker Lemar Marshall sacked Hasselbeck in the endzone for a safety, cutting the lead to 14-12. Neither team scored again until there was 9:57 left in the game when Graham booted a 24-yard field goal to give Cincinnati its first lead of the second half at 15-14. On the next possession, Hasselbeck moved the Seahawks to the opposition's 6-yard line. WR Nate Burleson was unable to hold on to a pass in the endzone, and the Seahawks settled for a K Josh Brown field goal, reclaiming the lead at 17-15. Palmer then connected with Chad Johnson on two big pass plays late in the fourth quarter, followed by 2 runs by back-up RB Kenny Watson for a Bengal TD. Cincinnati opted to try a 2-point conversion, but CB Jordan Babineaux stopped Watson after a pitch from Palmer. The Bengals led 21-17 when the Seahawks got the ball with 2:42 left in the game. The Seahawks sputtered near mid-field, and faced 4th and 1. RB Shaun Alexander broke through for 22 yards, and Hasselbeck hit Nate Burleson with a 22-yard TD pass on the next play for a 24-21 lead with 1:00 left. Seahawks linebacker Lance Laury forced a fumble during the ensuing kickoff, with FS Deon Grant recovering for Seattle. Two plays later Alexander ran for a first down (and 100 yards on the game), cementing the Seahawk victory and improving their record to 2-1.",

In the first quarter, the 'Hawks RB Julius Jones got a 27-yard TD run, along with DT Craig Terrill returning a fumble 10 yards for a touchdown.  The 49ers would reply with kicker Joe Nedney getting a 26-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Nedney gave San Francisco a 28-yard field goal.  Seattle responded with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 51-yard field goal.  The 49ers would hack away at the lead as QB J. T. O'Sullivan completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Bryant Johnson, yet the Seahawks closed out the half with Mare's 38-yard field goal. In the third quarter, San Francisco took the lead with LB Patrick Willis returning an interception 86 yards for a touchdown, along with RB Frank Gore's 2-yard TD run.  Seattle regained the lead as RB T. J. Duckett made a 1-yard TD run, along with Mare kicking a 32-yard field goal.  However, the 49ers tied the game with Nedney's 28-yard field goal.  In overtime, San Francisco's Nedney nailed the game-winning 40-yard field goal. Julius Jones (26 carries for 127 yards and a touchdown) got his first 100-yard game since Week 14 of 2006.",

However, the Colts responded with QB Peyton Manning completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark.  In the second quarter, Houston retook the lead with kicker Kris Brown getting a 33-yard field goal.  However, Indianapolis went ahead with RB Joseph Addais 4-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Colts managed to put the Texans in a huge hole with kicker Adam Vinatieri's 36-yard field goal, Addai's 8-yard TD run, and Vinatieri's 28-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Houston tried a comeback with RB Samkon Gado's 1-yard TD run.  Indianapolis would get their final score of the game with Vinatieri kicking a 35-yard field goal.  The Texans drew close with QB Matt Schaub's 1-yard TD pass to RB Vonta Leach.  However, the Colts managed to hold on to win.",

In the second quarter the Titans trailed with kicker David Akers making a 25-yard field goal. But they put themselves ahead with QB Kerry Collins completing a 26-yard TD pass to WR Kenny Britt. The Eagles replied with QB Kevin Kolb making a 5-yard TD pass to WR Riley Cooper, followed by kicker David Akers hitting a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Titans fell further behind with Akers making a 46-yard field goal. They soon replied with kicker Rob Bironas nailing a 41-yard field goal, but the Eagles continued to score in the 4th with Akers getting a 28-yard field goal.

In the first quarter the 49ers took the lead as QB Alex Smith got a 1-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. The lead was cut when kicker John Kasay nailed a 47-yard field goal. The 49ers scored with kicker Joe Nedney making a 24-yard field goal. The Panthers tied the game with QB Matt Moore completing an 18-yard TD pass to WR David Gettis. The 49ers fell behind in the third quarter with Kasay booting a 55-yard field goal. They eventually got the lead back in the fourth quarter with Nedney hitting a 38-yard field goal, and with DE Ray McDonald returning an interception 31 yards for a touchdown. However, the Panthers tied the game with Moore finding Gettis again on a 23-yarrd TD pass. Following an interception by 49ers backup quarterback David Carr, Kasay successfully booted a 37-yard field goal to give the 49ers the loss.",

The Texans used Dayne and rookie Chris Taylor to eat up the clock and exploit the Colts' suspect run defense, ranked last in the NFL, while taking pressure off David Carr and the struggling passing game. The win broke a nine-game losing streak to the Colts (11-4). It would be the Colts' last defeat before winning Super Bowl XLI. Mario Williams forced a Dominic Rhodes fumble on the Colts' second play. Anthony Weaver recovered the ball on the Indianapolis 47 and Houston would convert it into a touchdown, taking an early 14-0 lead. Houston led through most of the game until Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison connected for their second touchdown, a 7-yard pass that tied it 24-24 with 2:41 remaining. Carr and the Texans then engineered a six-play, 31-yard drive that ended with Brown's winning kick. Carr was 16-of-23 for 163 yards and a touchdown and was not sacked.",

After a scoreless first quarter, the Lions' Mikel Leshoure ran in three consecutive touchdowns, from 7, 1, and 8 yards out respectively to take a 21-point lead going into halftime. Leshoure became the first Lions rusher to score three touchdowns in the first half. After a scoreless third quarter, Detroit's Jason Hanson kicked a 42-yard field goal. The Jaguars finally got on the board when Micheal Spurlock caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Blaine Gabbert; they then completed a two-point conversion when Blaine Gabbert completed a pass to Rashad Jennings. The Lions responded with a 10-yard touchdown run from Joique Bell. Jacksonville scored the final points of the game with a 6-yard touchdown catch from Blaine Gabbert to Justin Blackmon; they again went for a two-point conversion, but were unsuccessful this time. It was the Lions' most lopsided win of the season and would also be their final victory of the 2012 season.",

        "passage": " Still looking for their first win of the year, the Dolphins flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for a Week 6 intraconference duel with the Cleveland Browns.  With QB Trent Green still suffering from a concussion from last week, back-up QB Cleo Lemon was given the start. In the first quarter, Miami trailed early as Browns RB Jason Wright got a 1-yard TD run.  The 'Fins would respond with kicker Jay Feely getting a 43-yard field goal.  However, Cleveland increased its lead with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Miami's struggles continued with Browns kicker Phil Dawson getting a 40-yard field goal, along with Anderson completing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Braylon Edwards.  The Dolphins answered with Lemon completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE David Martin, yet Cleveland managed to get a 20-yard field goal from Dawson as time ran out. In the third quarter, the 'Fins started to retaliate with Lemon getting a 5-yard and a 1-yard TD run.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, the Browns would pull away with Anderson and Edwards hooking up with each other on a 5-yard and a 16-yard TD pass.  Miami's only response would be Lemon's 4-yard TD pass to Martin. With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0-6 for the first time since 2004, but they also suffered their 9th-straight loss (the worst losing streak in franchise history). Along with the St. Louis Rams, it marked the first time since 2000 (Bengals and Chargers) that two teams began a season at 0-6.",

On the first play from scrimmage, Peyton Manning threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark. The Dolphins answered with a 14-yard touchdown run by Ronnie Brown out of the Wildcat Offense. The Dolphins and Colts kept going back and forth at each other with two field goals by Dan Carpenter and Adam Vinatieri to make the score 13-13 at halftime. After a scoreless third quarter, Ronnie Brown ran 2-yards for a touchdown to put Miami up 20-13. The Colts answered back with a 15-yard touchdown run by rookie running back Donald Brown. Miami than hit a 45-yard field goal by Dan Carpenter. But the Colts took the lead thanks to a 48-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Gar&#231;on. The Dolphins tried to rally at the end of the game but Chad Pennington was intercepted by Antoine Bethea to sucure the Colts victory. The Colts won the game 27-23 as the Dolphins dropped to 0-2. The Dolphins dominated the game in the time of possession battle, but lost the game with almost 50 minutes of offensive possession.",

They scored first late in the first quarter with a 38-yard field goal by Billy Cundiff. They added to their lead with a 62-yard catch and run TD by Derrick Mason from Joe Flacco. The Lions scored their only points of the game near the end of the second quarter with a 22-yard Jason Hanson field goal. A minute later the Ravens responded with a 59-yard rushing TD by Ray Rice. Baltimore finished out the first half with a 25-yard field goal. In the second half the Ravens scored 4 consecutive touchdowns. First a Le'Ron McClain 3-yard run. Then 2 by Willis McGahee: first an 8-yard run, then a 19-yard run. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens capped off their huge victory when Troy Smith ran in a TD from 15 yards. Lions backup quarterback Daunte Culpepper completed less than half of his passes (16 for 34) and threw 2 interceptions.",

McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didnt play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, Terrell Owens, who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After defeating the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons, the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the 2004 New England Patriots season. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14-14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Patriots won 24-21.",

McNabb set career highs, completing 64% of his passes for 3,875 yards, though he didnt play all 16 games. McNabb became the first quarterback ever to throw more than 30 touchdowns and fewer than 10 interceptions in a season. His success could be attributed to the fact that he had a reliable receiver, Terrell Owens, who got 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns in 14 games. After defeating the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons, the Eagles advanced to Super Bowl XXXIX, where they dueled the 2004 New England Patriots season. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14-14 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles and scored ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Patriots won 24-21.",
